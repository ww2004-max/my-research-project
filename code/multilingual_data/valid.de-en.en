In the context of the resolution under discussion , I call for the immediate withdrawal of Poland from the Protocol on the Application of the Charter of Fundamental Rights to Poland and to the United Kingdom .
Furthermore , I do not know what these impact assessments will achieve in terms of human rights and , above all , what the Commission will do if this House forms the impression that this is a watered-down solution and refuses to endorse it .
The solutions are difficult , however , let us not prejudge them and dismiss them outright , as the Commission has unfortunately signalled .
We have proposed - and in Biarritz I introduced - physical activity guidelines , which could help to promote the volume , intensity and quality of physical education training in our societies and especially in schools .
All market participants and their supervisors must know the criteria used to set ratings and be able to check these themselves .
in writing . - The relations between the Russian Federation and the European Union have seen several challenges in recent years .
The Commission takes good note of the views expressed by Member States that favour a treaty change , for which , as everyone knows , the unanimity of Member States is required .
Madam President , good evening Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the resolution which we hope to adopt here on Thursday sends , in my view , a very important signal , a signal which demonstrates that there is a great deal of support in this House for our typical European media model , which gives space to both commercial broadcasters , on the one hand , and public broadcasters , that is , public media companies , on the other .
Member of the Commission . - Madam President , I would like to use my speaking time by responding to some of your questions and comments in this , in my view , very responsible exchange of views today .
Member of the Commission . - Mr President , honourable Members , first allow me to pay tribute to Parliament , in particular , to the rapporteur , Mrs Matias , for your commitment to addressing Alzheimer &apos;s and other dementias .
It supports the efforts of African , Caribbean and Pacific ( ACP ) countries to reduce poverty and ensure sustainable economic and social development .
Fortunately the Council and Parliament have found an extremely useful area of agreement in this period of uncertainty , which has been made worse by the CAP &apos;s closing balance sheet and by the threats hanging over the agricultural budget .
This model has clearly been unsustainable , resulting in the build-up of significant fiscal , which means a high general government deficit and growth debt stock , increasing interest payments and macro-economic , which implies a high current account deficit and external debt outflow of income imbalances .
This may perhaps be explained better than I have explained it by an interview with Mr Cohn-Bendit , which I quote word for word : &apos; It is absurd to compare Mr Berlusconi to a dictator : there are no prisons for dissidents , he has the support of the majority , and the centre-left has simply lost &apos; .
We agreed on various matters in this Council : firstly , that it is correct and appropriate for the EU to hold a common position on body scanners and , more generally , on all of the protection mechanisms in our airports ; it does not make sense that some airports are less protected than others , because it essentially means that we are all less protected .
Council positions at first reading : see Minutes
Another point which I also emphasised in the opinion that I drafted for the Committee on Foreign Affairs is that a balance also needs to be found between , on the one hand , preserving the specific features of the European judicial system and , on the other , preserving the system of jurisdiction in Strasbourg , which has shown its effectiveness in protecting human rights at a pan-European level .
I also support the proposal to develop appropriate measures targeted at young people in the recovery plans drawn up in the economic and financial crisis plans and to ensure better integration of young people into the employment market .
in writing . - Council Directive 76 / 432 / EEC of 6 April 1976 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the braking devices of wheeled agricultural or forestry tractors has been substantially amended several times .
I am not here to reply on behalf of Mrs Merkel .
The 20 % 2020 energy efficiency target is a very long way off track .
It also means that massive pressure must be put on the US to bring that country to support this goal .
Greater competition is required in the sector and we must break up this historic oligopoly and try to bring in new , independent and possibly European organisations , which would therefore have a proper awareness of the economic context and reality of our continent , which is entirely different from the way of thinking in the United States .
In terms of the economy , there has been a drastic reduction in regional and infrastructural projects because the funds never arrived from Member States and those from the Commission remain in standby .
It would be wholly wrong if many millions of Britons and other peoples in the continent &apos;s nation states who oppose the European project should have their voice stifled by the political establishment .
I also approve of the statements in the report seeking to strengthen the EU &apos;s role in multilateral security organisations , in the G8 and the G20 , among others .
As I said , the Council intends to adopt conclusions on this on 3 December , and we will , of course , take into account the excellent resolution that you have produced and that you will vote on tomorrow .
I am all in favour of the transfer of technology , but our enterprises must also see the sense in investing in it , and therefore the intellectual property must not be watered down .
The problems deriving from divergences in Member States &apos; contract laws often discourage businesses , in particular , small and medium-sized enterprises , from engaging in cross-border trade and keep them from benefiting from opportunities and gains which the Internal Market offers .
Millions of pages of history have been kept hidden in the secret archives that still exist in Moscow .
( 1 ) consumers &apos; interests have been placed at the heart of the revision of the legislative package ;
That is why I have voted in favour of giving new impetus to the integration of the countries of the south and the east of the Mediterranean in international trade so that they can diversify their economies and share the associated benefits fairly .
Ladies and gentlemen , we should listen more to the Belarus opposition , to Alexandr Milinkevich , and only if we can be sure that Belarus has become genuinely democratic should we lift all sanctions against Belarus .
The role of the loans for the structural programmes is to increase the level of absorption and make more effective use and increase the leverage function of European financial aid resources , especially in the areas faced with low access rates to funds .
I am in favour of this report , which amends Directive 2000 / 75 / EC .
While the victims of Fascism and Nazism have received decent compensation , millions of victims of Communism have been forgotten .
In the meantime , I am afraid that the financial and economic perspective is only one side of the coin .
I very much welcome the Commission proposal to the Council to commit an additional EUR 6.3 billion to counteract the negative effects of the economic crisis , which is to say to accelerate implementation of the funds for the benefit of the real economy .
The Barroso II Commission , as the election of its President showed , is a continuation of the previous Commissions , the neoliberal policies of which led the EU into a situation of long-term economic , social and environmental crisis that is henceforth its own .
We would like to hear that .
However , I firmly believe that the Cohesion policy can , and will , make an enormous contribution to the Europe 2020 strategy , not just because we command a considerable budget in comparison with other European policies but , above all , because the Cohesion policy allows us to have sustainable development in our regions and ensures good monitoring of the restructuring processes and challenges in our regions .
We know that , especially in certain seasons , there is a great pressure on the countries in the Mediterranean , and this agency can help and support .
I trust that the historic Hungarian-Slovak reconciliation will bring major results , as there is no other alternative for the two countries .
the oral question to the Commission by Bairbre de Brún and Willy Meyer , on behalf of the GUE / NGL Group , on the waste crisis in Campania - B7-0801 / 2010 ) ,
I do wonder , however , about the content of several negotiating chapters .
Lastly , Romania gives cause for concern , since it is the only country in the European Union to have a law banning international adoptions .
I voted in favour of the proposal for a regulation precisely because guaranteeing clear and reliable information through the use of CE marking on marketed construction products represents another step forward towards a free , competitive market that is capable of protecting small and medium-sized enterprises .
In the Europe we dream about , freedom of expression is a fundamental value .
Burma
( SK ) I am concerned that the previous conferences have not produced tangible results in the area of non-proliferation of nuclear weapons .
To conclude , the EU should give a new impetus to the neighbourhood programme .
We should keep Kyoto on the agenda , but make clear that it can only be assessed in the light of a global agreement and not before .
in writing . - ( IT ) Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , I intend to use my vote to support the motion for a resolution on the alleged use of European countries by the CIA for the transport and illegal detention of prisoners .
I also agree that the Observatory &apos;s activities should be further extended to include the study of fiscal and labour law regarding the audiovisual sector , thereby strengthening its cooperation with the Member States .
One clear message from the crisis is that only public and state pensions are reliable and stable .
Finally , as this is my last speech , I would also like to thank you , Madam President , and all my fellow Members for the work which I have been able to do here for the last five years .
Europe must not be naive and must ensure that there is reciprocity .
I deplore that there was not enough support from the other groups to come to an agreement on that .
These are not mere percentages , but targets that have been scientifically researched as possible and vital in order to create a decisive turning point in the path that we have gone down towards the destruction of significant parts of our planet &apos;s biodiversity .
We have paid particular attention to the protection of workers who handle spent nuclear fuel and radioactive waste , compliance with the ALARA ( as low as reasonably achievable ) principle which is established in practice , the need for education and training as well as the need for the development of scientific and technological skills .
In yesterday &apos;s debate , we were pleased to hear Mr Barroso promise that the new Commission under his leadership would table the relevant proposals in the near future .
Similarly , I would like to express my delight at the fact that EU enlargement is one of the Hungarian Presidency &apos;s priorities .
The European Central Bank has not been without its critics , who have not called into question its independence but rather its policy on interest rates , which seemed to be too high .
( DE ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , from the point of view of the Committee on Budgets , the Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Subcommittee on Security and Defence , I should like to introduce another rather different emphasis into this debate .
Our request to you is very simple : you must not only send us the interim agreement on 25 January ; you must also provide your response to Parliament &apos;s three requests .
Member of the Commission . - Mr President , I would like to thank everyone who has contributed to what is an important debate on this issue .
However , I believe that this regulation should also be applied to European companies which invest in energy infrastructure projects in third countries and are directly linked to the energy networks of one or more Member States or have a significant impact on them .
I congratulate Taiwanese President Ma for his courageous and determined initiative to improve relations with the People &apos;s Republic of China .
Consumers who want a steak must be given a steak and not a piece of meat that has been glued together .
The Commission is the new de facto government of the European Union .
I think that the Lisbon Summit was a considerable step forward because we at least forged in the texts the beginnings of a new philosophy of equal partners in terms of rights and responsibilities .
In view of the above , such a system cannot be successfully introduced without penalties , and without restrictive penalties , as some have said .
At the same time , two thirds of people in the Czech Republic consistently reject the foreign base , in spite of an information and promotional campaign that has been going on for more than two years .
That is precisely what the policy of the European Union should be based on .
Cohesion policy has greater potential today than ever before , and this should not be underestimated ; it is capable of improving less-developed regions characterised by permanent geographical or natural disadvantages .
It would however be a terrible paradox if the main consequence of such an initiative would be to raise borrowing costs for some of the weaker eurozone Member States and contribute to the next crisis .
After the military inventions led by the Americans against Iraq , Afghanistan and other regions , we found ourselves in an era of ever-increasing crises and the prospect of even talking about nuclear disarmament could barely be dreamed or hoped of .
However , it is unclear whether we will still be able to make use of rapid deportation in transit zones , for example , which has proved its worth in Germany .
Such increased awareness , however , needs to be accompanied by strong economic incentives for business to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the goods and services they provide .
( IT ) Madam President , President of the Council , President of the Commission , ladies and gentlemen , in my political worldview , ideals need to be reconciled with interests .
They have to be harmless to humans and to the environment , and that is why we now need a review of all biocidal agents .
When you were in power , the journalist Ognyan Stefanov was beaten to death , and now you complain of censorship .
But it is equally important that we promote a better , more secure and prosperous future for the people of Afghanistan .
In the months and years to come we hope that the European Union will do everything it can to support the reform processes that are necessary .
The aforesaid committee decided to send a questionnaire to each Member State in order to clarify what developments had taken place following the European Parliament &apos;s investigation .
However , when it comes to the car industry , we realise that Europe is in a special situation at the moment , with a multitude of different kinds of support at European and national level , and we are at risk not only of the distortion that comes from giving public subsidies to individual players , but also of this distortion being increased if enterprises and industry in different regions are not able to obtain equivalent support .
I personally have always had doubts about the worth of this measure to small businesses , because I feel that they are better off managing their own credit than leaving this to legislation .
The passion with which people have spoken about the importance of what we do in terms of policy for the Arctic is extremely important for me as I take forward what I believe we should be doing in the future .
in writing . - I support this report on the conclusion of an interinstitutional agreement between Parliament and the Commission on a common transparency register .
I would describe the work that I want to do as this : we have the potential to do the political and the economic .
On the other hand , the European Commission should introduce a set of clear rules for providing financial support to local community projects in the vicinity of these areas , which allow controlled forms of tourism in the areas intended for conservation and generate economic benefits which can be enjoyed by the relevant local communities .
Today , attempts are being made to distort the truth about those tragic years , and information is being disseminated that these camps were Polish or Latvian camps , and not German .
A German goes to Hungary for dental treatment , a British national - if he has the means - goes to France so as to be operated on more quickly .
In addition to the Commission , I should like to address two issues relating to what is at stake tomorrow and the day after during this summit .
However , in the case of both countries , cooperation between the EU and the UN worked very well during rescue and assistance of the victims .
Based on the preparatory work carried out over the past few months , I believe that with the constructive criticisms included in the report the Bank will continue to receive the support required for its activity from the European Parliament .
I am afraid , Mrs Ashton , that I cannot share your initial statement on Afghanistan because it is too generic , too bureaucratic , too unfocused - like the current action plan .
We can all agree with the intention of the European Commission to achieve a competitive social market economy .
However , despite the improvements which we made , the dividing line between information and advertising is still blurred and the text still has a number of weaknesses and loopholes .
This has to be done and it has to be done by global cooperation .
We have to take account of the positive experiences of the regions .
It is essential that we do not make the same mistakes again .
The EU Member States must finance themselves and not tax their neighbours .
It should therefore provoke us to react to the extremely serious human rights violations that have taken place in this case .
Thus I reject this contrivance of European citizenship , which of course is a complement to the ongoing efforts to be advanced by the Lisbon Treaty to build the statehood of the EU and thus this notion that we all have to be , whether we like it or not , want it or not , EU citizens first and foremost .
Under the terms of Rule 177 ( 4 ) of the Rules of Procedure , I request that we postpone a vote on this point until the next plenary session and investigate the legitimacy of passing a resolution on this point .
As we know , the quality of the meat depends on the way the animals are treated during breeding and during transport .
That is a terrible road to protectionism and in the end will help nobody in Europe .
However , there are a number of questions on the timing and the funding of these proposals .
My third point concerns EU-NATO .
That the task is possible is clear from the rates already achieved in some countries .
I am particularly pleased about the adoption of the report on EU Policy Coherence for Development and the &apos; Official Development Assistance plus &apos; concept , which is an excellent report aimed at ensuring greater respect for developing countries .
Customers should be able to purchase a vehicle at competitive prices and choose the supplier they want to carry out the repair and maintenance services , no matter which distribution system is chosen by the supplier .
In this area it is important not to leave out the most isolated and outermost regions .
The main task of the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction ( EMCDDA ) is to collect data on drugs and drug addiction in order to prepare and publish objective , reliable and comparable information at European level .
Both of these conservative leaders have , for short-term party-political reasons , played down expectations ahead of Copenhagen , thereby making it more difficult to attain a good agreement .
I think that the Member States of the European Union must continue to give aid to reduce poverty and exclusion in the developing countries , continually adapting this to new circumstances and conditions .
The recent financial crisis has highlighted major weaknesses in financial supervision , both in individual cases and in relation to the financial system as a whole .
I hope that we have an agreement in the Council , but I also hope that it will be an agreement in which it is very clear that there can be no duplication in the Commission structures , with Commission delegations on the one side and the External Action Service on the other .
Such an outcome is also possible in Madagascar , provided that an election is held within the foreseeable future .
I , for example , cannot speak my mother tongue despite the fact that 40 % of the population of my country , Latvia , has Russian as its mother tongue .
I know you will do your best in that , and I wish you well in all your endeavours .
That is the important message for the EU .
( PL ) Mr President , Mr Liberadzki of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament began by praising the authorities of the European Union for their reaction .
These institutions should be completely independent of the administrations of Member States , and should even be empowered to act with executive authority in the event of a crisis .
This crisis should not therefore be used as an excuse to turn our backs on the road to further reform and liberalisation of the CAP .
Faced with national competences , the Member States do not have a natural appetite for sanctions and therefore their coordination , their cooperation is not good cooperation .
( BG ) It goes without saying that at a legislative and executive level , the European Commission and European Parliament are in the debt of the European citizens who are ultimately affected by the pollution which has occurred in our marine areas .
We must not forget that .
Another problem is the complete imbalance between freedom and security .
I should once again like to express my gratitude to the rapporteurs , Mr Surján and Mr Gualtieri .
Let us also remember this in this Chamber , because often it seems to me that we think the European Union will be able to face this global challenge alone .
In this context , the EU is too small to be an isolated island .
I believe that the trade unions and the employers are seriously concerned that CO2 policies will result in jobs moving outside Europe and that the entire raw material industry , whether it involves steel , aluminium or paper , will leave Europe , if we introduce regulations that are too strict .
However it needs to be clear that , despite the actions and measures taken on the road to achieving ever greater energy security , much more effort is needed , including serious political activity , so that we can see the light at the end of the tunnel .
I want a specific answer .
In the conference conclusions , the importance of the promotion of a system of lifelong training and capacity-building for assuring the quality of services is mentioned .
( Standing ovation )
Firstly , we have learned that coordination between all governance levels is essential , as is clearly stated in Mr Cortés Lastra &apos;s report .
The Hungarian press produced a document regarding this .
We must now move forward and ensure that these authorities can effectively carry out their crucial oversight role over EU financial markets .
And finally the permanent crisis mechanism has been described as a tool to strengthen the eurozone .
I would like to ask you how you actually intend to handle this .
However , there are a number of people in the EU - not least the three million people in the UK who currently take advantage of the opt-out - who will be looking for a commitment from him that , during an economic downturn , his Commission does not want to make it harder for people to work .
( ES ) Mr Barroso , you are regarded as a champion of environmental protection , and I congratulate you for it .
The changes include streamlining measures , on the one hand , and clear definitions of the responsibilities of flag states and port states , on the other .
Last but not least , I hope that retail , which is a pillar of the European economy , would also be high on the political agenda .
Future accounts reports and reviews must indicate how responsibly and successfully recipients handle EU aid .
We need a strong European Union of all 27 Member States .
The Commission has recently made a final call to EU Member States to activate the European missing children hotline 116 000 as soon as possible .
The Union currently has 143 nuclear reactors , with nuclear energy accounting for 30 % of the energy mix .
At the same time , many of them - almost all of them , in fact - still have major surplus problems and problems complying with the Financial Regulation and the Staff Regulations year after year .
Last but not least , Fiji does not have a democratic regime .
In this context , an emphasis must lie on the maintenance and improvement of the international order .
Mr President , the accession of the EU to the Transport Protocol of the Alpine Convention is a small but perfectly formed piece in the jigsaw of a new transport policy in Europe .
The tragedy of our Union is that , through too many people &apos;s eyes , it has become an elitist project , pushing its ideology onto an increasingly sceptical public , according to Eurostat information .
I totally agree with those who said that investment support for sustainable energy can be very effective and very beneficial , particularly when focused on the local level .
These include almost 50 countries whose people are suffering from the effects of successive failures to implement the recommendations of successive United Nations conferences .
For this reason , I voted in favour of the report .
This raises the question not about transferring national responsibilities to European level , but about the need for the EU to give an assurance to its citizens about problems which extend far beyond national citizens .
We will have to wait and see to what extent the Copenhagen conference will change this .
We the people do not believe in making taxpayers fund policies to rescue the financial powers , whether in the United States or in Europe .
I agree with Mrs Matera and call on the Chamber , which remains sovereign , to approve the release of the Solidarity Fund , without translation if necessary .
Removing gas and other energy sources from the serious problems caused by the speculative markets , through tariff agreements that respect the producer countries and the transit countries , and that provide security to European consumers , would make it possible to guarantee security all round .
I support the draft Council decision on the conclusion of the Agreement between the European Union and the Republic of Croatia on the participation of the Republic of Croatia in the work of the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction because the number of deaths , compared with last year , is falling for all drugs except heroin , and progress is being achieved as a whole in the fight against drug use .
European gas consumers cannot be left at the mercy of monopolies .
Thank you , Commissioner .
Trans-European networks are urgently required .
in writing . - ( PT ) The agricultural situation and the problems facing the rural world cannot be dissociated from the system &apos;s profound crisis or from current policy , for example the common agriculture policy ( CAP ) , which bears the majority of the responsibility for the continued decline of agriculture in some Member States : everything is oriented toward the interests of large-scale farmers and northern European agro-industry , destroying family agriculture and compromising the viability of small and medium-sized farms .
There are benefits , particularly for producers who are going to gain by it , but there are also concerns - concerns about the impact on the environment and particularly concerns about the impact on producers in the European Union .
Whilst it stresses the right to advertise , it ultimately asserts the patient &apos;s right to information .
Let me demonstrate this using some examples .
The future reform of the CFP must ensure a sustainable fishing system and we are in favour of a new management system based on fishing effort .
FGM not only causes very serious and irreparable injuries to the physical and mental health of women and girls , - in some cases has even been fatal - but is a violation of fundamental rights enshrined in international conventions , prohibited under the criminal law of the Member States and in breach of the principles laid down in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the EU .
Mr President , I wish to speak in support of the motion for there not to be a resolution because I heard Mr Schulz say something which , in my view , is very important : if we really want this debate to encompass &apos; Europe &apos; and not just Italy , there is no point then voting on a resolution entitled &apos; Freedom of information in Italy &apos; .
I can tell Parliament that the British Conservatives will not accept these irregularities .
I note with concern the recent attacks on members of the opposition and I hope that the Iranian regime understands how counterproductive this attitude is , and how likely it is to isolate them internationally .
Next week , our European leaders during the summit need to speak about more than pipelines and free trade .
I welcome the efforts that have been made towards clarifying Union law in order to make it more accessible to all EU citizens .
So far , this conflict has claimed 1 000 lives in 17 days .
On the same occasion several hundred people were illegally detained and tortured in prison .
Where the development funds are concerned , the EU is the world &apos;s largest giver of aid .
We were also asked to provide information on fundamental rights-related improvements in the work of UN Sanctions Committees .
In the light of the new challenges facing the Union , it has become crucial for a facility to be in place that enables the Commission to introduce changes to the budget when the funding set aside is insufficient to reach the strategic objectives , namely within the framework of the priorities established within the EU 2020 Strategy .
Mr President , I am sure one thing we can all agree on is that Heads of State or Government are extremely busy men and women .
Every Member State has the duty to provide these women victims with access to free legal aid and shelter facilities which will allow them to build a new and better life for themselves and their children .
in writing . - ( PT ) Bearing in mind that the new framework for governing the planning and performance of aid activities , established in 2006 in order to make Community aid more effective and transparent , has revealed some inconsistencies in its implementation , namely with regard to the exceptions to the principle of non-eligibility for EU financing of costs related to tariffs , taxes and other charges , I approve the adoption of a second reading of Regulation ( EC ) No 1889 / 2006 , which grants greater legitimacy to the other institutions ( Parliament and the Council ) in the adoption of strategic documents by the Commission within the scope of delegated acts .
In Libya alone , we managed to support through our aid 55 000 people being able to get home .
Bulgaria and Romania must be admitted so that they can assume their share of the responsibility , along with the other Member States , for protecting Europe &apos;s borders .
Unfortunately , I believe this pesticide package may fall into the latter category .
When we have a summary of all the requirements arising from the studies , the Committee will be ready to consider the whole package of requirements carefully .
I think that it is fair to say , and I believe in plain speaking , that Parliament was quicker in deciding this than the Council .
Parliament is calling for only the bare minimum of what would be desirable , taking the budget constraints of the Member States into account .
It has to be welcomed that disarmament becomes an essential element of the agreement - to be more precise - on a par with democratic principles , human rights and the rule of law .
Third , I take the European Parliament &apos;s views as welcome input to the early stages of the EBRD &apos;s fourth capital resources review which we will conclude at our annual meeting in Zagreb in May 2010 .
We must ensure that the organised people traffickers do not have the opportunity to make billions of euro in profit out of people &apos;s fates as a result of our right of asylum .
I believe that this report by Mrs Buitenweg is a perfect illustration of this .
Hundreds of thousands of animals now travel with their owners each year across Europe .
in writing . - ( RO ) I voted in favour of the motion for a resolution on the major natural disasters which have taken place in the autonomous region of Madeira and the effects of the storm Xynthia in Europe .
Moreover , it is high time for the EU to also take care of radio frequency identification ( RFID ) .
These are , for our constituents , sensitive issues that ought to be properly determined through the national mechanisms of each Member State .
Madam President , I abstained on the 2010 report on Iceland .
in writing . - ( PT ) I voted in favour of the European Parliament resolution on investment in the development of low carbon technologies ( SET Plan ) , because , in order to effectively tackle the economic crisis , investing in those new technologies that have the greatest potential for job creation should be a priority .
As a matter of fact , the report and the resolution constitute an outline of the objectives , priorities and interests of the EU &apos;s major powers , whether in the Balkans ( Kosovo , Bosnia-Herzegovina ) , Eastern Europe ( Caucasus , Black Sea , Belarus , Georgia , Russia ) , Middle East ( Gaza Strip , Iraq ) , Mediterranean , Central Asia ( Afghanistan , Iran ) , Africa ( Chad , Sudan , Somalia , Democratic Republic of the Congo ) , Asia ( China ) or Latin America .
When we see the cycle of violence flaring up again in the Middle East , this too is fundamental .
I think that this decision will increase the safety of public figures and will have a beneficial effect on the development of democracy .
This leads on to my third point , which is that our support programmes for Haiti have to take into account what the country has and does not have .
Therefore , we think it is important for the wording to include the perspective of the Member States on this question and to take into consideration the different traditions and positions of the Member States with regard to foreign , security and defence policy .
As it is not really possible to change the shape of the vehicles , the engineers will have to focus on the engine and the mechanical components , which , according to the experts , is a long-winded process .
For example , in 2006 , the total allowable catch was 36 000 tonnes .
The Solidarity Fund is the instrument which normally responds to these situations , but it does so after a very , very long period , from nine months to a year , and this is after a disaster .
Hence , we are seeking - in the Commission and now with the Member States - this comprehensive approach to innovation , looking beyond DGs &apos; portfolios and even national origins .
I am voting for the document for the reasons given above .
Lack of discipline in transactions is a particular threat to small and medium-sized enterprises in countries which have been hit by the economic crisis .
The People &apos;s Republic of China will have to get used to that if it really wants a different role .
Then our new economic framework would be fully in place and all its tools could be used to assess national budgets , Stability and Convergence Programmes , as well as National Reform Programmes by 2012 .
If you will allow me , I will conclude by underlining the importance of legal certainty in this matter because , of course , when we are dealing with sensitive issues like trade , like anti-dumping measures , like countervailing measures , we need to have very well established procedures and we need to have a clear division of roles and responsibilities .
2 : The inclusion of milk in Article 186 gives the Commission an operational tool that can be deployed instantly , but that does not mean that Parliament will no longer monitor the issue .
Mobility requirements and residential requirements are changing .
In addition , European research programmes such as the Seventh Framework Programme , which apply for up to 50 % cofinancing , are not very suitable for small and medium-sized enterprises .
It is also important for the elections to be held in Germany on 7 June and elsewhere from 4 to 7 June that people &apos;s attention is drawn to just how important our work is .
I would urge all the Member States and the Commission to fight against sending these people back to Afghanistan .
Again , because we need to defend this Community that has succeeded in responding to a crisis like never before , and given that we will see , for example , what happens to the dollar and the United States in the future , we will also see how the euro does in fact have its advantages .
I also voted in favour of keeping paragraph 9 , declaring the end by 2010 of the direct production-linked subsidies for tobacco growing because of its implication for health issues .
The extent to which the unrestricted and uncontrolled storage of data or such access to data is compatible with the fundamental rights remains controversial .
I think this is certainly not in line with the practice in Member States .
In my opinion , this is essential information that must always be communicated to the consumer .
On a positive note , however , the report provides for the creation of a network of immigration liaison officers posted to consular authorities and to international organisations , with responsibility for preventing illegal immigration and facilitating the repatriation of illegal immigrants .
The Commission would very much welcome it if , in the near future , the Court of Auditors were to consider a distinction between areas where the risk of error is different and informs us about the actual added value of the management and control systems introduced in the 2007-13 legislation .
Enormous emphasis is placed on good governance , combating corruption and the principles of the rule of law , and this is the work that is guiding the EU .
Advertising of prescription-only medicines is banned within the European Union , and remains so .
This is the dual challenge contained in the Europe 2020 strategy .
Now that Parliament belatedly has a chance to react , its biggest political groups conspire to deliver an empty resolution .
This will help to promote the exchange of scientific knowledge and research .
At the same time , it is important that we handle this matter with due caution ; without delaying new discoveries and their implementation , we should nevertheless pay attention to the health risks as well .
Do you know whether the Albanian secret service and the Albanian justice system are prepared to cooperate ?
However , we cannot deny the reality of the situation - gambling is an important economic activity which does not entirely comply with the rules of the internal market .
From these scientific estimates , it follows that there is a very realistic fear that spawners might become virtually extinct by 2012 .
( SV ) Madam President , I believe that it is extremely important that the progress being made by the candidate countries that are involved in negotiations is also recognised and stressed .
If I look at Parliament in my own country , some estimates say it will take us 200 years to reach parity at the current rate of progress , so we are not going fast enough to really achieve proper equality .
Nevertheless , there are elements which are worthy of support , such as streamlining the registration of materials .
In my opinion , we have succeeded in doing this .
As the result of the vote in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs has also demonstrated , there is complete agreement among the political groups that the employment policy guidelines for the period between 2008 and 2010 constitute a suitable - and yet sufficiently flexible - framework for the objectives to be attained .
- ( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the irony of fate would have it that this stage of the debate is being held without the President-in-Office of the Council , who should have been with us ; Mr Topolánek is not here .
I welcome the new SWIFT mandate for the EU-US agreement as part of the terrorist financing tracking programme , especially as the Council and Commission have learnt the lesson from the past and included Parliament &apos;s stringent demand in negotiations , which is that higher standards should be applied to data protection .
The experience of implementing the European Union Emission Trading Scheme has completely discredited the value of regulation through the market and clearly demonstrated the ineffectiveness and perversity of its instruments .
The Treaty of Lisbon opens up a new dimension for citizens to assert their interests .
I therefore welcome the Commission &apos;s recommendation for negotiations to be opened with a view to concluding these agreements .
Eighteen years after the first directive on pregnant workers and workers who have recently given birth and / or are breastfeeding , the economic and demographic situation in Europe has certainly changed .
He has been very coy about that , but I thought you should know .
Our group therefore fully endorses Europe &apos;s new , renewed commitment in the Sahel and we are anxious to see the new strategy , discuss it in detail and support its implementation .
Take a look at the figures produced by the World Meteorological Organisation .
in writing . - ( EL ) The report on updating the European Security Strategy openly supports even greater militarisation of the EU in order to strengthen its military capabilities for its imperialist interventions .
We now continue with the one-minute speeches on matters of political importance .
For the moment , there is a lot of talk about rapprochement , but these are declarations rather than concrete steps .
If the European Union wants its work to be credible , it should be confining itself to its core tasks rather than inflating its own role in combating the crisis .
It is therefore important for us to call for a definitive system of VAT rates and to clearly point out that a review of the VAT Directive should use the single market strategy as a guideline rather than the separate interests of the individual countries .
Taken seriously , Europe 2020 can direct our local , national and European economies towards tomorrow &apos;s sources of growth .
( ES ) Mr President , the reopening of the European Union-Mercosur negotiations comes within a positive context that will enable dialogue to be restored with regard to trade relations .
Our Court of Auditors is currently unable to do this .
( PL ) Mr President , a crisis is a disease which usually ends not only in recovery , but also strengthens and creates mechanisms of resistance .
The Court said that we need supplies to be managed in future or else the whole system will be incapable of being financed , and we need a dairy policy based on quality products in the European market .
I think that our demand to know which countries and citizens are being brought before the Court in The Hague as defendants and which are not is a legitimate demand .
We also call on the Commission and Member States to offer financial support , training and consultancy and also to simplify the procedures for setting up enterprises in the social sector .
These are important legal regulations which are of great interest both to consumers and to the transport sector .
I would add that , for years now , we have been saying that we need coordinated timetables , harmonised economic forecasts and shared diagnoses in order to decide on the economic strategies of the Member States of the euro area .
in writing . - I agree with the rapporteur that we need to define the principle of territorial cohesion more clearly .
on behalf of the Verts / ALE Group . - ( FR ) Madam President , like those who have preceded me , I clearly deplore the seriousness of the situation today , the acute political crisis and also the risk of clashes that could well break out in the hours to come .
I invite you to take these figures into consideration when assessing the huge contribution women in many local communities make to development , which often follows a disproportionately low participation in decision-making processes .
I believe that the proposed new protocol for the Fisheries Partnership Agreement with the Union of the Comoros serves the interests of both parties .
Mrs Lunacek &apos;s motion for a resolution clearly shows the limited progress made by the country and I believe that the problems highlighted make its joining the EU even less plausible , as this would accentuate the heterogeneous character of the Union , to which the latest accessions are contributing .
That is why I would like to impress on the Commission the need to include technology transfer measures in rural development .
If we go over this mark , we will have done irreparable damage to our planet and that means that it is damage that we will not be able to reverse .
Europe has set this priority very high on its agenda .
I should like to conclude on a dissenting note as regards the merits of the mutual evaluation procedure , which has proved itself to be extremely useful , by allowing for greater transparency in national regulations and creating a structured dialogue between Member States .
The trouble is that the very existence of the CSDP and all its duplicative structures is divisive and encourages allies to think twice about robust commitment to NATO operations .
With all the concern about the destruction of the rainforests , this must not be used as an excuse to prevent forest owners in Europe from exploiting their forests , because forest management in most EU Member States is exemplary .
This is why it is so important today that we are discussing the public investment banks , which are at exactly this interface , which allow the market to function and which have a public mandate to represent our future interests .
Madam President , would you agree that political discrimination is not only unlawful but is also an attack not just on me , but also on the functionality of this place and , most important of all , on the voters and the entire democratic process ?
This is a great opportunity concerning a technical matter , but an important one for European consumers .
Firstly , we have not been lacking in respect for anyone , especially not people who might be victims , but we considered that compassion , moral indignation and insults do not add up to a policy .
Female employment in fisheries , both direct and indirect , is very important , because if women in coastal areas did not stand by fishermen , these areas would be much poorer and much more sparsely inhabited , because needs are met by people , not just legislative texts .
Involving the Arab League is a significant opportunity to bring all states together to jointly find solutions for conflicts in the region .
I propose allocating this amount to the Europe for Citizens programme .
In addition , as I am sure my esteemed fellow Member is also aware , there has been a huge incidence of fraud within Europol in recent years , which we discussed recently in this House , and this strikes me as reason enough to bring police policy , too , back within the fold of the Member States .
So the main message of the report is to put in place health insurance , based on a solidarity system , to allow the population to have access to heath care .
When the European Commission is being formed , each Member State should propose both men and women as commissioners .
I am observing with great interest the EU pilot programme , which is supposed to be a tool enabling a rapid response to all cases of incorrect application or adaptation of EU law to national legislation .
The main aim of the Council &apos;s draft proposal on patient safety and the quality of health care , including the prevention and control of hospital-acquired infections , is to define an integrated approach under which patients can transfer safely to high quality health care centres and where all factors having an impact on this will be taken into account .
I am always open to new ideas , and one example , which is taken up in your report , would be to upgrade the Foreign Ministers &apos; meetings into a Transatlantic Political Council with a heavier focus on strategic themes .
At the same time , however , the revision of the telecommunications package , which basically restructures the way in which and the criteria by which the radio spectrum is allocated at European level , has demonstrated that the rules governing the financing of broadcasting services are now of fundamental importance to the future regulation or deregulation of services relating to the information society , innovation and services of public and economic interest .
For consumers , this will effectively mean high-quality publications being replaced by cheap , unverified , unimaginative publishing , additionally accompanied by ubiquitous advertising .
It is important to adopt a common position on structural and pre-accession funding policy .
A general audit of Ireland under this article was carried out across a number of sectors in 2008 and a report will be available shortly .
Nevertheless , there are still questions surrounding which methods and criteria to use in order to begin working towards providing more equitable support .
Some people appear to be confused on this point .
After the many delays that we are guilty of , it has become obvious to everyone that Europe needs real economic governance , which must be particularly stringent for those countries that have adopted the euro .
With regard to the other institutions , I will be paying very close attention to all the aspects related to the Council &apos;s operating expenditure , especially the Secure European System for Applications in a Multi-vendor Environment system , in which there is a specific reference to the need for improvements in forecasting the Council &apos;s budget , and also to isolated aspects relating to the European Ombudsman and the European Data Protection Supervisor , whose budgets appear to be severely reduced .
With the help of the European Union , will we manage to gather the required political will and ensure alternative means of transporting passengers so that we can avoid such consequences in similar crisis situations .
We have some concerns about Hungary &apos;s media law .
We do , of course , have governments of the centre and of the right in Europe .
That is why I voted against recital 25 .
Secondly - and finally - we will never get to the situation that Proinsias De Rossa spoke about of having a better society post-depression than we have now .
To pass over this opportunity would be an error and the Commission intends to play its role .
This report , by Mrs Rosbach , is based on a communication tabled by the Commission on 28 September 2009 called &apos; GDP and beyond - Measuring progress in a changing world &apos; , and it reflects this need to provide politicians and researchers with data that is more comprehensive .
Greek governments allow burned areas to be developed and for national land to be appropriated and EU funds are inelastic .
( DE ) Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the volcanic ash of last year showed us in an impressive way where our weaknesses lie .
On the one hand it is the responsibility of producers to ensure that their products conform to the valid European laws , and on the other hand it is the responsibility of the Member States to ensure proper supervision of the EU market .
That is the outcome of the vote .
As politicians , we have a constant tendency , if we want to achieve something , to throw a new layer on top , additional regulation , an additional programme , an additional funding option .
The Wałęsa report amends the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organisation ( NAFO ) Convention of 1978 and represents a step forward for cooperation and management of fisheries resources in the north-western Atlantic .
That implies ad hoc legal assistance affording access to specialist external lawyers .
You fought for national self-determination .
in writing . - It is important in this time of financial and economic crisis that we maintain and strengthen workers &apos; rights to ensure that the costs of the crisis do not fall on those least able to bear it .
For example , it would be unacceptable for origin marking to concern only finished products , thus making it possible to import all the components separately , to assemble them in Europe and to describe them as being &apos; made in Europe &apos; .
I believe that it is Parliament &apos;s responsibility , as the only elected body of the EU , to safeguard and protect the independence of the Ombudsman in fulfilling his duties towards the European public .
Taking into account the above circumstances , as well as Georgia &apos;s strategic significance for the European Union in the European Neighbourhood Policy and the newly established Eastern Partnership , I endorsed the resolution on a Council Decision providing macro-financial assistance to Georgia .
Secondly , for small and medium-sized enterprises in particular , the regulation contains a number of important relaxations which will facilitate their economic activity and their dealings in Europe &apos;s internal market .
Madam President , Commissioner , Mrs Mathieu , ladies and gentlemen , immigration in Europe is undoubtedly a highly important and hugely significant political , economic and social issue .
The representatives of capital in the European Parliament who voted for the &apos; SWIFT agreement &apos; are unaware of its content , given that only &apos; trusted &apos; MEPs were allowed to read the &apos; confidential &apos; text , while the European Parliament has rejected it twice in the last six months .
As has been mentioned , over 100 000 flights were cancelled , tens of millions of business and holiday passengers were not able to travel as planned , goods and cargo were delayed or not transported at all , businesses were affected and our European carriers and airports suffered catastrophic financial losses .
However , it is comforting that , in the wake of the opposition and concerns expressed by the members of the Committee on Culture and Education on the downgrading of policies on education and training , especially at a time when unemployment is on the rise and is causing problems in numerous Member States of the European Union , the Committee on Budgets tabled the necessary amendments , which I supported , and increased the initial planned appropriations ( for example , in the case of Article 150202 on lifelong learning programmes ) .
Thirdly , the programmes in both Greece and Ireland are still in the relatively early stages .
This is a matter of millions of jobs in the world economy and in the European Union .
I will not give you the floor .
I voted for this report concerning the setting up of a European Partnership for Action against Cancer for the period 2009-2013 .
Unfortunately , within the European Union things do not go any further than these soapbox speeches .
There is no point hiding behind good intentions and promises .
( SL ) I would like to resume my speech , because the victims &apos; relatives have asked me to express their gratitude to you today for the understanding and support which you have shown in passing this resolution .
Maintaining the European economic system was imperative of course , but this must not make us forget the extreme poverty that is raging at our borders ; extreme poverty made worse by a crisis for which we carry the burden of responsibility .
Indeed , the European Union must equip itself with exemplary legislation on the protection and assistance of victims of terrorism as part of this multiannual Stockholm Programme .
I am not going to take every blue card because we must go ahead with our discussion .
I can assure the honourable Members that the Hungarian Presidency is striving to find the way to progress with regard to the particularly problematic issues of this proposal and will continue to do all it can to bring the matter to a successful conclusion .
The ALDE Group fully supports close cooperation in this area but it must respect fundamental rights , including privacy , and be progressed within a democratic and transparent framework .
Mr President , following the Barcelona Conference in 1995 , not all of the potential intrinsic to the natural relations between countries lining the Mediterranean basin has yet been developed .
In this , we are counting on the Members and President of the Commission as well as the Members and President of the European Parliament .
That is why I shall take great pleasure in voting in favour of this resolution and in following up its appeals to the Russian authorities to protect human rights activists .
The fight against climate change must be conducted on a global level and with everyone &apos;s involvement , but the idea that our position must depend on that of other countries is irresponsible and does not do justice to the role that the EU has set itself , namely a leading role in guiding cultural revolutions at a global level , primarily the fight against climate change .
( PL ) Madam President , I should like to return to the issue of sanctions against employers whose subcontractors employ illegal workers .
I am delighted at what Mr Cioloş had to say .
Allow me to suggest that one way to ameliorate that crisis would be to keep faith with our voters and put the Treaty of Lisbon , as we promised , to a series of referendums .
We have no desire to keep talking to a brick wall .
The Commission , with the concerned Member States , is also closely monitoring the abnormal mortalities observed in oysters over the past few years and has taken measures to control the virus that seems to be associated with these mortalities .
( PT ) I would like to point out that , in island regions , air transport is sometimes the only means of access and that operating conditions depend on the volume of passengers and cargo carried .
I am extremely proud that the Swedish Presidency has been given the opportunity to lead the EU at the summit .
A special place in this policy cycle for social integration is given to the World Program for Action Concerning Disabled Persons .
A major transformation of the world order is taking place , challenging the European Union to engage more actively with current and emerging world powers and with other bilateral and multilateral partners , in order to promote effective solutions to problems which affect both EU citizens and the world at large .
We need to ensure that consumers are informed about it when it does actually happen and that they are made aware of the fact that they should not have to eat contaminated food .
I have spoken to many people in France about this incident , as I am involved in the Commission-funded project on rescuing people with disabilities in disasters .
It includes everything from lorries to aeroplane jet engines and telecommunications equipment .
Fellow Members , I call on you to support Mr Coelho &apos;s report , which will allow us to give the Council a clear , strong political signal that Bulgaria &apos;s and Romania &apos;s rightful place is in the Schengen area this very year , in order to make external borders more secure and give our citizens greater peace of mind .
There were some cases where solidarity could have been greater .
This would involve general criteria for all nuclear power plants as well as special criteria for each particular design , age , location , seismic risk , flood risk and other factors .
These proposals can probably be designed in such a way as not to require a Treaty amendment and they deserve careful analysis and discussion in the Council working party .
( PL ) Madam President , I would like to make sure I am understood correctly .
( PL ) Madam President , the motion for a resolution of the European Parliament , as discussed during the consultations held by the European Commission , deserves our support .
You cannot continue to be so-called &apos; dessert economies &apos; if you are going to compete in a globalised digital world , and I welcome that aspect of the Economic Partnership Agreement .
Current self-isolation is leading to destruction in Iran and has a toxic impact on neighbouring countries and on the rest of the world .
It is an intelligent proposal .
We are by no means out of that crisis either , but are sinking deeper in , because we have not succeeded in taking appropriate measures .
Hence , we are not talking about a quid pro quo , but about a negotiating chapter as such .
It may even be a matter of life or death .
We are not being short-sighted here , just pragmatic .
I am disturbed , however , about the media reports today that Haitians are protesting because , despite all efforts , they still have no tents over their heads or enough food and water .
I believe this is right also with the countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council .
- Report : Genowefa Grabowska
However , whatever they stand for , in the long run it is freedom and respect for human rights and freedoms that must be given priority by us here in this Chamber and by the European Parliament as a whole .
If some progress could be achieved to bring more satisfaction to the EU car industry , then employment levels , strong GDP and expected standards of living would really benefit and be preserved .
An area of my own country , the dripstone cave of Aggtelek , is also classified as wilderness .
The treaty opens up new opportunities .
Ireland has only just escaped bankruptcy , the state budget in Greece is certainly not yet back in good shape and the overall situation gives no reason to sound the all clear .
All users from different countries pay these tolls if they appear on this network .
Now I am hoping that I can shortly leave this debate and ask another Commissioner to take over .
This would be to the mutual benefit of citizens and businesses in the EU and Andorra .
I believe that monitoring , control measures , tightening up standards and establishing a mutual recognition system , all of which are emphasised , are good solutions from which to begin .
For all the rest , there was no regulation ; we would have been accepting deregulation , and we cannot do that .
I think it would be wrong for the news to go out from this House that , from now on , all is well with cross-border healthcare .
Nevertheless , when credit is issued , these companies are obliged to provide guarantees of 100-150 % , making them liable to go bankrupt .
They will also focus on bridging the financial gap by fully using the available Structural Funds to fund high-speed broadband and , where there are no incentives for private funding , direct public financing .
Although , to answer Mr Swoboda , it is clear in the treaty coming into force on 1 December that the High Representative goes directly into his or her new job , but has to be part of the Commission approved by Parliament .
However , the Commission has opted to introduce a measure which is simple , effective and timely and which will make it possible : ( a ) for manufacturers in the EU to sell tractors , overcome the current difficult economic crisis , find new resources for research and comply with the limits laid down by European law for environmental protection purposes ; ( b ) for farmers to replace their oldest tractors with new ones whose engines will be less polluting .
In Austria , we had the Zwentendorf nuclear power plant that was never connected to the grid .
The Competitiveness Pact defines certain parameters which eurozone countries in particular should adhere to .
The question , Commissioner , is when will this procedure be completed ?
May I say also in conclusion that there are many people here who consider themselves federalists and yet want to see some sort of harmonisation in taxation .
Thank you again to all my colleagues for their support on this report after such a long time .
There is also an agreement in this House that the freedom of the media is a problem to be looked at in all Member States .
I therefore welcome this package &apos;s aims , but I hope that we will not in the future be forced to repent the means that we have used .
That is why I voted for the report on the SESAR Joint Undertaking .
The Commission suggests now to include only those goods that consumers can find in retail stores .
Quite the contrary , through its position , it is calling on the European Union , the Member States , and Baroness Ashton to support its proposals .
It is essential to strengthen employment standards , such as freedom of association , collective bargaining , the elimination of forced and compulsory labour , discrimination in employment and occupations and the abolition of child labour .
It should be said that the negotiations currently under way between the leaders of the two communities on the island are positive and that a better atmosphere of trust has been established .
One representative did not take part in the decisive vote , and another , Mr Wennemer , voted against , because he considered that it was a political decision .
In my opinion , he can rightly claim to have made a great deal of progress during that time .
I therefore call on the Commission and the Council to investigate the possibility of transposing the provisions of the UN Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families into the legislation of the European Union .
How and based on what criteria can one be reimbursed ?

Mr President , these past 16 months I have spoken 77 times in this Chamber and I have ended every speech with a call for the Lisbon Treaty to be put to the people : Pactio Olisipio censenda est .
So yes , it is necessary to impose a maximum rate of taxation in order to encourage short journeys , piggyback transport , maritime transport and inland navigation , and it is necessary to make the entire Union and its neighbourhood strive for the best possible social conditions .
I also think that the EU &apos;s history , the way it works and citizens &apos; rights should feature as basic components in the curriculum at European level .
It is strange , and also a little sad if truth be told , that since 2004 , the rate of reforms has been too slow , that , in actual fact , the EU is now less willing to give Turkey a fair chance and that in Turkey , enthusiasm for membership has waned .
The new directive should promote genuine and effective competition between all market participants , and at the same time ensure equal conditions for all payment services providers and a high level of consumer protection .
It has to be the right Europe , however - not the wrong package .
It will be more difficult to agree a long-term strategy , which will have to include a realistic position on Russia , because it is - currently - the main supplier of crude oil and gas to Europe .
Whether it be in economic terms or in environmental terms , the treatment of waste has become a major issue in this consumer society of ours .
It is these arguments , and not the empty phrases about unity , that make up the debate on a federal Europe .
For this reason , the Commission clearly stated a need for additional resources to be spent on infrastructural investments and investments earmarked for competition quality and employment .
Anyone who thinks that the European Union is going in the direction of doing less and devolving power need only look at today &apos;s vote .
We have to understand that agriculture and forestry are probably one of the most crucial areas to look at if we are to get to grips with the emissions problem .
The Red Cross was allowed to do this at the Guantánamo prison .
I would also like to call attention to the fact that the Eighth Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development has energy security , the fight against climate change and the environment as its priorities .
However , I also note that India is still off track on most of the Millennium Development Goals ( MDGs ) such as infant mortality , maternal health , child malnutrition and the battle against malaria , tuberculosis and HIV / AIDS .
However , we must be able to ask questions of a good partner .
It is right that a foreign national in Britain should receive emergency treatment when necessary , but no foreign nationals should be admitted to Britain unless they have first taken out adequate travel and health insurance .
The directive , therefore , is a huge opportunity and a source of hope for all patients in the countries to which I refer .
Finally , the issue of the bilateral and primarily political Nord Stream project should be settled through respecting the rightful interests of all states around the Sea and certainly not before the Russian Government joins the Espoo Convention .
It is about time that the European Union began to properly acknowledge the views of European citizens and listen to the voice of the people .
Mr President , I , too , wish to use this opportunity to strongly condemn and to express our dismay at the recent events in Honduras .
I therefore agree entirely with the rapporteur that it is necessary to enhance the situation of political parties at European level and prepare a clear and uniform legal status and financing model for them .
The effective implementation of the directive under consideration and the compensation for the deficiencies noted in the course of transposing and applying the earlier directives would supplement the defence available to European Union citizens against discrimination .
That is why , everything we have debated today , the red tape , the technical issues , need to be resolved as quickly as possible .
The fair road charge system proposed in the Eurovignette Directive will allow us to use our scarce resources in a more sustainable manner .
The consolidation measures taken by Greece are important for enhancing fiscal sustainability and market confidence and have been strongly welcomed by the Commission , the Eurogroup , the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund .
The vote will take place on Wednesday .
The own-initiative report under discussion , put forward by Parliament to keep a close watching brief on the implementation process of the directive in national legal systems , assesses the work done so far by the Member States .
in writing . - ( IT ) Our supermarkets are located further and further away from home and we are less and less likely to wander around the shelves , with a product in our hands , surrounded by the smells of fresh food and people &apos;s comments .
Mr President , I would like to thank the Commissioners and rapporteurs .
( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to say something because , as was mentioned previously , the Italian Embassy and other embassies were attacked yesterday in Tehran .
We will emerge from the crisis not by pinpointing scapegoats ( Europe , the International Monetary Fund and others ) , but by rolling up our sleeves - and when I say &apos; us &apos; , I am of course talking about the political class , but also about all of the 500 million European citizens .
Since data collection is already mandatory for statistics on other modes of transport - road , rail and via inland waterways - I think a common framework which includes the collation of maritime transport statistics is appropriate , and it can also help to ensure maximum comparability between the different modes of transport .
As we have heard colleagues saying tonight , prevention is better than cure and there are far more problem substances than those heavy metals and brominated flame retardants which are restricted under the current RoHS Directive .
I already have seen strong evidence that PNR is essential to identify and to prevent terrorist attacks .
In contrast to most Members , I believe that the Commission &apos;s proposal will ensure greater protection for personal data and , at the same time , a more effective fight against organised crime .
I regret that such an objective still seems far from becoming reality and I hope Europe and Japan will persevere in their efforts to attain it .
Both the government of Pakistan and the authorities in Pakistan must do something about the law against blasphemy , which carries the death penalty in Pakistan and is often used to justify censorship , criminalisation , persecution and , in some cases , the murder of members of political , racial and religious minorities .
We have to improve public demand for culturally diverse audiovisual content , which will be very important , so we have to get the youth , the young public most of all , to see European films .
in writing . - ( SV ) The European Parliament has today voted in favour of including sports and recreational fisheries in the common fisheries policy .
There is no question about that .
Enough of the policy of restricting agriculture , because it is a policy which is short-sighted and devoid of imagination .
I therefore call upon the Commission and the Member States to join forces and ramp up the fight against tuberculosis in order to succeed in controlling and eradicating this disease .
in writing . - This report takes a detailed and thorough look at the causes of the economic crisis and the developments that have been made at EU level in order to prevent , pre-empt or at least diminish the impact of future crises .
Therefore , I should like to thank the Commissioner for her response , as it contains positive elements to help us really achieve something of benefit to 500 million European citizens .
The citizens of Europe expect us to provide genuine answers .
To provide for all eventualities but , above all , to ensure that Messrs Mladić and Hadžić will , in any event , undergo the same procedure , an effective , highly-qualified and sufficiently equipped mechanism will need to be put in place that can take care of the rest of the tasks , even after the Tribunal &apos;s mandate has come to an end .
This will enable quicker and more efficient investigation into the causes of an outbreak by also exploiting the expertise of other European researchers and laboratories to the full .
I will therefore vote against .
I consider that to be the only guarantee of peace there , as Martti Ahtisaari also said before me .
That was wrong , because what was needed was to strengthen the size and mandate of this mission , especially since the centre of organised crime in Guinea-Bissau targets Europe directly .
In fact , in some Member States , there is great potential for this .
I think this is progress .
I myself have visited a port which has very sophisticated equipment for discovering shipments of illegal cigarettes , but this is the province of each individual Member State .
in writing . - The Conservative Delegation fundamentally opposes the EU involvement in defence which this report aims significantly to extend .
I do not have a romantic and bucolic vision of the &apos; escape to the country &apos; : quite the contrary , I know that such a lifestyle choice has costs , and often means leaving behind easy access to the infrastructure essential for modern life .
This is a very great achievement for Ukraine .
Although there are several problematic issues , I will only mention one of them .
Today , however , Community legislation restricts compulsory labelling of the place of production to just certain products , thereby vouchsafing them special treatment and leaving out agricultural products of major nutritional value and priority for consumers .
The Member States must integrate this priority to acquire basic skills ( reading , writing , arithmetic ) into their educational programmes before their pupils specialise .
However , this is a step in the right direction and an attempt at the maximum possible protection .
On the very sad case of the loss of human life in Cuba , the death of Mr Orlando Zapata , I would like to express the condolences of the Commission to his family and strongly condemn the continuous imprisonment of more than 200 political dissidents in Cuba as well as other expressions of disrespect for fundamental human rights .
Back in 2003 , following the horrific fire disaster , we were able to grant solidarity aid amounting to more than EUR 48 million to Portugal .
At this stage , we are keeping Albania and Bosnia in Annex I to the regulation , while reaffirming the European Union &apos;s commitment to help these two countries meet the criteria in their road map , and thus to be exempted from the visa requirement in accordance with the procedures in force .
I firmly believe that rural development must continue to be a crucial aspect of the cohesion policy .
Guaranteeing protection for the boreal forest is extremely important and it is important that we ask Canada to comply with the international agreements that we have jointly signed , but which only we are respecting unilaterally , and that should be the basis for any further cooperation .
Firstly , no reduction in budgetary commitments for cohesion policy .
However , the Tories have failed to back our proposal for a clear prior authorisation system , which is crucial to protect precious NHS resources and NHS services .
It is really damaging to the values of the EU to praise human rights advocates like Kovalev and , at the same time , to surrender to Mr Putin &apos;s claims that broadcasting alternative information in the Russian language by European satellites is something hostile .
Finally , I raised awareness about the need to evaluate the impact on the credit rating of the European Union since it acted as guarantor of the European financial stabilisation mechanism .
I support the report because it includes the gender dimension of the CAP .
Nonetheless , we still have a great deal to do before we are equal to our task , which is to be able to judge politicians from a political perspective .
The request will be moved by the rapporteur , Mrs Bauer .
You Social Democrats want to force people to request prior authorisation .
My call for us to maintain certain market measures acting as a safety net for farmers and the prices of their products has also largely been supported .
Once again , as I said to Mrs Sarnez , the European Parliament &apos;s commitment would also be very important in this respect , in the context of relations with the burgeoning parliaments and political parties in these young and new democracies .
This is precisely the issue that we , Members of the European Parliament , have been fighting for : to obtain the same level of guarantee , that is , a prior procedure before an impartial judge .
For this I would like to offer you my sincere thanks .

This report refers to a draft Council decision on the conclusion of the Agreement between the European Community and the West African Economic and Monetary Union on certain aspects of air services .

If a friendly solution cannot be found , the Ombudsman can make recommendations to resolve the case .
Trends in the machinery and equipment production sector changed dramatically in the EU in Q4 2008 in both Denmark and Germany , where falls in production in excess of 25 % were seen .

This is a unique opportunity to collectively celebrate the economic , political and social achievements of women , past , present and future .
That being said , several ACTA parties have taken the momentum created by the ACTA negotiations to revise their domestic legislation along the agreed lines .
I would like to express my most definite and unambiguous support for the strong views of Mr Olbrycht and Mrs Mazzoni , namely , the strong views I mentioned in earlier debates in the European Parliament , also shared by Commissioner Hahn , that although GDP does not reflect all dimensions of the stage of development , it is still the most reliable indicator available .

The EU-Canada Free Trade Agreement , like the others , also covers services and worthy , but inconsistent concerns are being expressed relating to &apos; negative lists &apos; or others , which do not remove the threats also hanging over public services .
( DE ) Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , this is an appropriate and important project to realise energy efficiency and save more energy .
First , bringing the employment rate up to 75 % , notably through the greater participation of youth , older workers , low-skilled workers and the better integration of legal migrants ;
I am able to tell you that an initial package of approximately EUR 300 million , involving 24 to 25 countries , will be presented in February , while the general plan for the use of the entire facility will in any case be presented by the Commission and adopted by 1 May 2009 .

I urge the new Czech presidency to negotiate a pan-European agreement allowing Belarusian children affected by the Chernobyl disaster to travel to any Member State within the EU .
Member of the Commission . - Mr President , first of all the Commission would like to thank the rapporteur , Ms Grabowska , as well as the Committee on Constitutional Affairs for their excellent report .
( NL ) Mr President , with one minute to speak about a budget of EUR 141 billion , one must of course confine oneself to the essentials , namely that , at all levels - Community , national , regional and even lower - so-called &apos; European &apos; money is really spent less efficiently and less carefully than money from closer to taxpayers .
Ladies and gentlemen , as I have already indicated , the situation is complex , and has its own inner dynamic .
It is a type of violence that determines the course of the lives and the situations of women and young girls .
If we were in the ancient Roman senate , a senator would surely stand up in his toga and say to Mr Trichet : &apos; Quousque tandem abutere , Trichete , patientia nostra ? &apos; - how long are you going to try our patience , Mr Trichet ?
After this disappointment , it is important to regain the initiative .
I think that Member States now have a moral obligation to flex the full extent of their diplomatic and political muscle with Israel to end this violence .
My group is strongly opposed to the ability to pay becoming a criterion for the provision of healthcare and to patients being turned into customers .
We will also be in favour of the removal of the remaining technical nuclear weapons in Europe and it would be helpful in supporting ideas to bring the fuel cycle under international control in order to make sure that countries that want to develop nuclear energy have peaceful access but will not be able to abuse that militarily .
The rights of citizens cannot be traded for the general indifference of the Member States or for Solonic warnings by the European Commission .

( DE ) Mr President , nuclear fuels , chemicals and computer programmes can be used for peaceful purposes , but they can also be used for military purposes .
We have had numerous debates , which have really made me see that Parliament and the Commission do , quite naturally , share the same opinion and ambition .
It would also be good to know more about how the interest from the loans provided is to be used , and about the administrative fees secured from the EU budget .
Only then will the 2020 strategy succeed - not with the cowardliness of the governments and the insistence that someone pay for what the relevant partner in Europe does not deal with themselves .
I do realise that using the enhanced cooperation mechanism gives rise to many fears .
Mr President , Jacques Delors was wrong when he claimed that you cannot fall in love with the Single Market , because there are so many ardent feelings expressed in the debate surrounding this subject .
Mr President , I would like you to consider with the Conference of Presidents timetabling the one-minute speeches earlier , because in the last part-sessions this was pushed back to the last hour of our discussions .

Member of the Commission . - Mr President , Mrs Ibrisagic , I was one of those people watching on television when these terrible things happened .
These policies of liberalisation , deregulation and privatisation - implemented , let us be clear , at the behest of European big business - are having disastrous consequences for the lives of working-class people , with mass unemployment and savage attacks on living standards .
In the Commission proposal for a recast of the Dublin Regulation , this principle remains untouched .
Although better late than never , the next aggression could be a bloodbath of horrendous proportions if you fail to make this humanitarian crisis one of the top priorities on your agenda right now .
However , this regulation needs close supervision as many SMEs in Ireland struggle to borrow from Irish banks in receipt of EIB loans .
However , as long as that is what the rule says , it is incumbent on us to obey it in letter and spirit .
It enables not just greater coordination , but also greater accountability by governments at national and EU level .
I endorsed this document because it is aimed at ensuring that national defence systems are consistent with EU defence systems , as well as coordinating strategies with the most important global actors , such as the United States , Russia , China , Turkey and the Arab countries .
( DE ) President-in-Office , I think that the Czech Presidency is taking a very positive and proactive approach to this issue .
While we are trying to sort out the children &apos;s problems , we need to beware of demonising parents who are moving .

We think it should be said that the Spanish State has been criticised on several occasions by international organisations such as Amnesty International for continuing to practise torture .
For the Council , it was not at all so clear cut .
The rights of minorities are enshrined in the legal order of individual EU Member States , and also confirmed by many international agreements .
The Commission was in effect asking Parliament to make a judgement on the rules surrounding the classifications without knowing what they actually were .
Reviewing the European demographic pyramid , it is clear that in future , we have to pay more attention to the labour market for elderly people , and I agree with the report that the ageing of the population also offers great opportunities to improve competitiveness and capacity for innovation , and thereby to increase economic growth and employment .
Therefore , the European Union and the European Parliament should not interfere in this matter with the South Korean authorities .
The second political principle is that we must guarantee a high level of protection of the rights of both consumers and workers .
Ladies and gentlemen , the situation prevailing in the Middle East also takes us back to the need to accept our responsibilities at international level .
Admittedly , in France a state of natural disaster has been declared , which will facilitate aid to disaster victims , but this does nothing to detract from the need to take coordinated European action to supplement the Member States &apos; efforts to protect people , the environment and property in disaster-stricken towns and regions .
Any company operating within the territory of the European Union , which faces such a change in its economic environment , should use the same early warning and preparation measures as its competitors in the European Union , and this , incidentally , would encourage honest competition between companies in accordance with internal market rules .
I hope - and I am confident - that your votes will provide the basis for an agreement .

A person suffering from Alzheimer &apos;s cannot go one hour unaccompanied .
Today &apos;s votes on the motions for resolutions are based on a debate which takes some beating in terms of its political one-sidedness .
We had a little over half the average GDP when we joined in 1973 , but now we have one and half times the average GDP , notwithstanding the financial difficulties of the country at the present time .
I therefore hope that monitoring systems and the macro-supervisory body can be established as soon as possible .

I think that is enough to get us all working together to prevent such tragic incidents from reoccurring .
There is certainly evidence of commitment and will by the Commission , but we must undoubtedly implement a serious policy to prevent tax evasion by front companies that evade tax laws with a simple click of a mouse through the Internet .
I therefore agree with the target of 147 g of CO2 emissions per kilometre for new light commercial vehicles in the EU , if it is confirmed that this option is viable .
I am very surprised at this position , Commissioner .
As a result , many people view having easy access to the internet , and the wealth of information available online , as a necessity .
I very much welcome the Commission &apos;s readiness to come out with a mandate , as it did as soon as possible after the vote in February , and I am also very keen to have this mandate approved as soon as possible by the Council of Ministers .
If colleagues think back to the early 1990s , when we had the whole Delors Plan with the white paper on the social package and so on , this was considered groundbreaking and innovative .
My first message to the Commissioner tonight is to thank her services for their leadership on this , but to say that I think this initiative needs to be much better known .
To be honest , even with regard to the points in the proposal to which the Commission has stated that it has objections , I would maintain that the essence of what we want to achieve is very similar , for example , as regards printed material and the possibility of helping those countries that have constitutional problems , including Sweden , to solve them in the proposal .
( BG ) Thank you , Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to congratulate the rapporteur , Mr Coelho , for the balance he has achieved in this report between ensuring a higher level of security for international travel documents and protecting the personal data and human integrity of the European Union &apos;s citizens .
This applies to investments of up to EUR 50 million which , until now , have been evaluated by the EU , because we are responsible for taxpayers &apos; money .
We have always been a committee with strong participation .
Indeed , it is often large processing companies that buy produce from farmers and abuse their dominant market position in order to sell the produce on to distributors at exorbitant prices .
You will have to negotiate with the Council and come to a decision and I must say to you that the Council has not moved one millimetre over the last seven months , and that was not the fault of the Belgian Presidency .
In the areas where ethnic Hungarians live alongside Romanians , it is a well-observed rule that schools operate sections where the language of instruction is Hungarian for all children of Hungarian origin .
I would like to stress that financial aid from the EU will help workers who have suffered from major structural changes in the economy and trade to reintegrate into the labour market .
Cancún would be not nearly as bad , of course .
Our objective is to seek the approval of this text , which will be clear and comprehensible to EU citizens , which will respect primary law including the subsidiarity principle and which will fulfil the declared objective of establishing legal certainty for EU citizens concerning the application of their rights when receiving cross-border healthcare .
With the climate , the financial market crisis , the Treaty of Lisbon and the new Commission , you have had really difficult tasks and issues to deal with .
In this connection , we should also consider whether the proposal that the United States is considering is a sensible one , namely , that where only one credit rating agency is chosen by issuers , a second , independent body could be encouraged to give a rating and this second body could be allowed to work on the basis of the information that is publicly available .
Although regulation is essential in some sectors , I personally prefer transparency and a duty to inform .
( DE ) Mr President , Madam Vice-President , today you are sitting on the other side .
In a partnership , it is important to ensure wherever possible that both partners are equally powerful and that is not yet the case .
Are you aware that the investigation which you just mentioned as being with the Ministry of the Interior was moved there from the judicial authorities when the Bulgarian Socialist Party , which is part of your group , was in power ?
The first ship in the area after the humanitarian crisis began was HMS Cumberland from our own country , which was in the area because she was on her way to be scrapped !
Without infrastructure , it will simply be very difficult for us to compare with the European Union in terms of level of development .
I believe that there were very many of us who , when the government announced its democratic initiative , its democratic opening-up , recognised just how bold a step this was and , at the same time , believed that this huge ambition represented a long road ahead , a road that would probably be full of pitfalls ; the pitfalls appeared fairly quickly .
However , we have a unique opportunity to turn the crisis into an opportunity .
Saakashvili , in my view , was indeed intemperate in seeking to regain control of sovereign Georgian territory , and made a terrible political mistake - though it was , after all , Georgian sovereign territory .
- ( DE ) Madam President , I would like to thank Mr Lagendijk , as well as the Committee on Foreign Affairs , for having ensured , through this resolution and this debate , that the subject of Kosovo remains on our agenda .
The CAP underpins the policy of uprooting small and medium-sized farms and supporting the monopolies and their profits .
The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs would certainly have preferred less .
We should give congratulations here , regarding the fact that at last , Parliament has quickly got new regulations both for Members and for aides too .
In fact , it is not always a question of money , as the funds are there , but of what I might call a &apos; structural &apos; slow pace - sometimes in State management , sometimes in administrative inertia and sometimes , unfortunately , in both - which gets in the way of that impact we are always talking about , which is essential for our regions and our citizens .
We must pay due attention to domestic violence in order to bring it out into the open and help the victims , who are women and children .
in writing . - I abstained on the final vote on this report .
People are rising up against dictatorial despots and that is a good thing .
The administrative detention of hundreds of thousands of people , systematic torture in prisons , religious and political repression , executions - all these methods are incompatible with the People &apos;s Republic of China &apos;s obligations as a member of the United Nations .
That was true before the incidents in Japan and it remains true now .
Impact studies should be applied to all legislative proposals , they should have a clear methodology , and they should be undertaken with full independence and transparency .
on the oral question to the Commission on the volcanic ash crisis , by Saïd El Khadraoui , on behalf of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament - B7-0204 / 2011 ) ;
I call on the relevant Member States to give priority to the implementation of this strategy , thereby ensuring economic and social development for more than 120 million citizens living in this macro-region .
We cannot afford to wait until 2012 for this to come into force .
From the perspective of budgetary control , which in modern terms also covers the actual output and performance of European programmes and institutions , the EIB has definitely earned its high rating , in particular with regard to political reliability .
For this I wish to thank all my fellow Members who played a part , the shadow rapporteurs , the rapporteurs and everyone else .
The response of the public authorities has been to refuse to submit to the institutions , with the resulting risk , danger and lack of political concern .
We have been negotiating for a year and we have still not been able to secure EUR 5 billion out of an overall European Union budget which this year amounts to more than EUR 130 billion .
Just as they did in Belarus , the Soviets soon planned the deportation of the leading sections of society in the Baltic States , and the first mass deportations took place during the night of 13 to 14 June .
There are also several other interdependencies which have a serious impact on Europe and on the countries of the Horn of Africa , such as terrorism and migration .
The Members want to vote on this later and we will be in serious difficulties if we do not keep to our speaking times .
( RO ) I wish to thank the Commissioner for the clarifications he has provided on this issue .
If Belarus can make this serious progress , then I think it is also essential that we reciprocate with a significant package of measures .
I am concerned that the resolution recognises &apos; Iran &apos;s right to enrich uranium &apos; which is of course correct under the rules of the IAEA , but , given the continuing impasse in the negotiations , is contrary to the UN Security Council resolutions .
in writing . - The four Irish Fine Gael MEPs voted for the report on the Single Market Act for enterprises and growth because we support the overall thrust of the resolution , but we do not support CCCTB , as we have explained in previous explanations .
We assume that it sincerely regrets its decision .

The long term and the short term : both must be addressed .
So confidence in the quality of information and the way in which it can then be used by Member States is also an extremely important part of the enhanced cooperation we will be seeing .
Given that the European Union is a legal entity based on treaties and legislative acts , it is vital that these are properly implemented in a uniform way across the 27 Member States .
What Pakistan is trying to do at this point is actually to help itself out of the mess that it is in after the devastating floods .
It is time that Member States committed to implementing a genuine freight development policy and thus to making consistent use of all rail and road transport infrastructure .
I am watching with just as much concern how Russia &apos;s influence on the Ukrainian economy , its energy sector , but also other sectors , has been systematically expanded .

What is needed is that good will .
It is paradoxical to be referred to as an opponent of Europe for this reason .
We are going to do our best by means of our budget and by means of CFP reform .
The EU needs to be more present in the region , and the entire European neighbourhood policy needs to be revised , which will make it possible to promote democracy more effectively not only in the Arab countries , but also in countries neighbouring us to the east , such as Belarus .
We have had many setbacks and some disappointments , but every time the overriding case for the Treaty has won through - the compelling case for a democratic and effective Europe .
We need to be clear , one more time , what Greece actually teaches us - namely that we are being brought face to face with the weaknesses in our Treaties , and those in the Treaty of Maastricht in particular .
However , the dependency on Russian gas is a common security problem , bearing in mind that the energy weapon can be used at any time , especially against Russia &apos;s former satellite states .
Moldova is a potential candidate , prepared to come into line with the European Union as part of the political and economic integration process .
Greenhouse gas emissions have been decreasing as a result of the increased efficiency of EU agriculture , constant innovations , the use of new techniques such as CO2 storage in the soil , and developments in the production of sustainable , renewable energies .
I do not think that we are taking away the rights of the nation states , but instead we are providing an added value that could benefit all citizens .
Tomorrow &apos;s extraordinary summit of the European Council must reach agreement on the EU &apos;s role in the region .
An increase in funding for the LIFE + programme .
When I made these points , the answer from the report &apos;s supporters was that it would not be used that way , and that everyone knows what it really means .
In the original text , the reference is wrong .
However , as the term &apos; social housing &apos; suggests , what is involved here is not housing in general , but housing provided on the basis of social criteria .
The European Union cannot continue to give contradictory signals .
Its objectors do not even seem to have read the report .
If there is money available to meet vehicle requirements , there is also money to meet wage requirements .
( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , first I all I feel it is my duty to thank the rapporteur , who has done a marvellous job , and , as chairman of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs , I must also thank all of the members of the committee and of both committees - the Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Committee on Development - who delivered the opinion , for their very swift work .
Despite the fact that illegal immigrants are treated as victims and protected by the directive , they too are being given a dissuasive message that it will no longer be easy for them to find employment and , consequently , that there will be no attraction in obtaining work even on unfavourable terms .
That entails political commitments on market regulation , which is what is under discussion today .
I voted in favour of this report since I agree with its overall content , which I see as one more step towards establishing new Union mechanisms for planning , coordination and supervision in the economic , budgetary and social spheres of the EU .
There are many indications that the utopian and socialist 2020 project will share the fate of the Lisbon Strategy .
Kazakh laws which are based on international law must be applied appropriately and transparently in legal proceedings against the human rights activists Yevgeny Zhovtis , Yesingepov and Dubanov .
The forthcoming Swedish Presidency will , in particular , be making targeted efforts to facilitate enterprise by women , an important European strategy for the future .
The same is true of our neighbours in the East and , in particular , in a country which is an immediate neighbour of the European Union , Belarus .
As long as these outstanding differences , for example , concentration of media ownership and party political power over the public media , are not openly discussed , the Italian pattern will insidiously convince many people .
Acceptance of the values of respect for human life , protection of civilians and promotion of humanitarian aid can form the foundation for reaching a lasting ceasefire , achieving peace within Palestine and between Palestine and Israel .
Tunisia also rightly takes an uncompromising approach to Islamist jihadi extremism .
The situation in the Czech Republic provides evidence of the fact that there is a real problem .
At the current time , of course , the cost of labour is falling because we want to keep people in employment for as long as possible , because getting them back into employment is several times more expensive than keeping them in employment .
For that reason , it must be clear that the President of the European Council has only the legitimacy of the Heads of State or Government , and in any constitution , any operational president who is not answerable to Parliament is directly elected by the people .
I would like to introduce both of them .
I come now to the main question , which is always controversial , concerning border disputes .

Thirdly , a precautionary period should be established for migration which , if necessary , could be extended through comitology .
The ECB adopted a different strategy for the crisis than other leading central banks around the world .
The authorities in these states should concern themselves with undertaking concrete reforms that allow their citizens access to democracy , freedom and justice , similar to what exists in most countries .
Secondly , the draft agreement mentions an appraisal body , which I described to you , and also the Presidency , the Commission and representatives of national data protection authorities , the involvement of which is intended to check that the matter is dealt with correctly .
That may also contribute to strengthening research and development , not just within these industries , but also in a section of European industry that feeds off their development .
We hope that the Iranian judiciary will ensure a fair and transparent appeal trial without any delay , with all the guarantees provided by the Iranian legislation .
I would like to congratulate Mr Casini on the excellent work he has done .
Let us make no mistake : what it comes down to is that extra money from the common agricultural policy is funding the inadequate allocations of other categories of expenditure .
Even though health is the responsibility of each Member State , we have everything to gain from adopting a global approach to cancer prevention and treatment , and that is what I am supporting here .
I would add that we have outlined in this part the elements of the overall approach that will enable development and migration to be linked .

The Commission has announced that it will take the necessary action once its officials have analysed the Lithuanian legislation , and my question is : has the analysis been carried out yet and have your officials , as part of that analysis , considered what the consequences could be for the recognition of same-sex couples from other Member States ?
I really think that we should take a stand on this and consider whether we should not have tightened up the rules .
But when Member States do receive that aid from the European Union under this provision , they should be encouraged to spend it in a way that respects the principles of the Union - in other words , not ignoring the need for social protection and social inclusion .
The acts of violence committed against women and children in the last few weeks , during the conflicts that have broken out in North Africa , are no surprise because , unfortunately , women living through armed conflicts have increasingly become a target for humiliation , torture , possession and control , the intention being to wholly or partly destroy a particular group .
Egypt and Malaysia are among those countries where Christians live in extremely dangerous conditions , face persecution , expulsion from their homes , abductions and murders , and their churches are being closed .

This is a major achievement , and it is only fair to congratulate Prime Minister Topolánek on his constructive role as a Council .
The PVV also attaches great importance to protecting the privacy of Dutch citizens and takes the view that , where these interests clash , they need to be carefully weighed up against each other .
Many thanks also to the staff involved and to the Commission , to you , shadow rapporteur and Mr Dimas , and also the French Presidency of the Council , but also thanks to fellow members who were not intimidated by the completely exaggerated figures from industry .
Another important aspect relates to the exchange of good practice and the mobility of specialist medical staff , as well as to providing citizens with free access to information about cross-border assistance .

Politicians who behave in this way surely do not understand that they are doing exactly what Lukashenko expects .
But could the Commissioner please confirm that this means that investors can still invest freely in stocks and bonds in third countries which are not rated in Europe or which do not have equivalent status ?
To give but a flavour of the pace of activity we have all been involved in : for instance , I was at a working dinner of the Paris Co-Chairs on 15 January , the Summit meetings in Sharm el-Sheikh and Jerusalem on 18 January , and EU ministerial meetings with Israel on 21 January and with a group composed of Egypt , the Palestinian Authority , Jordan and Turkey on 25 January .
Here we are , on the verge of the second Greek bail-out , and you say , &apos; there is no alternative &apos; .
( ES ) I too , of course , am delighted about the happy ending to the Alakrana case , but I fear that unfortunately it may not be the last such case .
The first is COSI , the Standing Committee on Internal Security .
This was the first step .
I come from a landlocked country , but nevertheless , as a European , I feel responsible for protecting our oceans against ongoing pollution caused by cheap business interests and for integrating the principles of the third maritime package , which is urgently needed , as the Committee on Legal Affairs has proposed .
I believe it is necessary , as Mrs Ţicău points out , to set aside additional funding for the Galileo programme and , hence , to create perhaps a Galileo reserve fund within the EU budget to cover any additional costs , taking care not to harm the other programmes .
While Brussels never tires of taking all kinds of competences away from the Member States , the Commission , stating that it does not wish to interfere in internal affairs , has declared conflicts between minorities a matter for the states concerned .
Yes , it is not deadlock , it is not a stalemate , it is a protracted political crisis .
It is therefore essential to include gender mainstreaming in the mainstream of European Neighbourhood Policy and in the centre of our efforts towards creating an effective and structured approach to gender equality in the countries covered by the policy .
That would be the worst thing that could happen in Yemen and something that would probably poison relations in the entire region even more .
Echoing Parliament &apos;s position , the Spanish Presidency , as I said , considered this to be a crucial issue .
It now falls precisely to politics to restore citizens &apos; faith in light of the severe economic crisis we are experiencing .
Mr President , we have quite rightly heard a lot about economic recovery in the Commission &apos;s proposal for the EU 2020 strategy but not enough , in my opinion , about poverty , and that is why I was delighted that you mentioned poverty reduction in your speech .
So I urge you , even now , to vote in favour and allow the Council of Ministers to do the right thing to make sure that it is absolutely proportionate and subsidiarity is respected .
The compromises were achieved under serious time pressure .
Subject : EU financial supervision
These are the obligations required upstream and downstream of any legislation if we are to try to construct the finest body of legislation to serve the citizens , consumers and businesses working and living on European territory .
( PT ) We are talking about a very important matter , especially bearing in mind the problems that occurred in the financial sector with this type of alternative investment funds .
A political agenda could include concerns that the euro could , in future , replace the dollar as the pricing currency for oil , for example ; a business and economic interest agenda could include simply amassing greater power and wealth by destroying sovereign rights , including shared sovereign rights , within the European Union .
It seems that the EU acts firmly in the field of employment and social policy only in times of crisis , and then does so by imposing cuts in social spending and wages .
We have heard several speakers express their regret that the panels have been dropped .
We virtually had to make them up on the spot .
I will not forget how John Paul II in his speech at the Brandenburg Gate in 1996 said , looking back , that people had been separated from one another by walls and lethal borders .
In the report of Mr Remek , we call on the European Commission to move towards a solution to the problems that have arisen and to ensure a funding procedure for the programme such that it can achieve full operational capacity in 2018 .
It is also important to point out that this facility should serve the sole purpose of supporting entrepreneurship as a means of creating new jobs , by helping to realise solid business ideas , and it should not be used for social support or to boost consumption .
I know it was perhaps somewhat disappointing for you that we felt we were not able to give this proposal a thorough review and get it to first reading before the end of this mandate .
As for offshore financial centres , I would say to Mr Geier that it is something that we are very interested in .
Unfortunately , neither Israel nor the Palestinians have as yet complied with this request .
The waiver of an MEP &apos;s immunity is always a sensitive issue to address , but in some cases requests for waivers should be analysed in the context of an MEP &apos;s duties .
We need to establish policies that are environmentally friendly while also boosting the economy and reducing the alarming levels of unemployment .
It is precisely because political conflicts are blocking this process that we should strengthen the economic field .
Countries with large amounts of transit traffic hold considerably different opinions to more peripheral countries , like my own , which depend on large volumes of traffic for importation and exportation of goods .
Specifically on nuclear issues , it is important to draw lessons from the events in Japan .
The time has come to make clear how we will proceed .
In particular , regarding this last point , SMEs and business development are already one of the strategic sectors .
We must also take into account the progress made by the authorities in Tripoli , which have successfully shifted the country from a situation of isolation and embargos to becoming open and economically and diplomatically dynamic .
The first is that the Bank should focus even more on the countries most severely affected by the crisis , thus further increasing the inner cohesion of the Union .
Secondly , we also need to ensure that we have the production needed to leave fossil fuels and make it possible to have low prices without carbon dioxide emissions .
Much evidence points to the fact that Iran is responsible for sponsoring terrorism .
That is recognised not only in Europe but also globally , as we go through unprecedented financial times .
The draft resolution states that children are particularly vulnerable and thus at greater risk of becoming victims of trafficking in human beings .
It is not reasonable that this should lead to this committee being punished for choosing a more effective way of working than tabling a formal opinion .
As we know today , we are experiencing a crisis and , above all , seeing a fall in prices and agricultural revenues that is affecting cereal producers , livestock producers , whether pork or beef producers , and also - and I say this on behalf of Mr De Castro - olive oil producers , and which is hitting and has hit dairy producers extremely hard .
We shall remain vigilant and if something goes wrong , we shall try to put it right .
The banking sector , closure of production capacity , lack of fresh money and the contraction of the labour market are basic problems for Member States .
The High Representative Vice-President needs the authority to manage the service , but the service also needs to serve the EU system as a whole - most obviously , the President of the European Commission and the President of the European Council , as well as the other Commissioners with a role in external relations .
This new basic treaty should include the genuine separation of powers , a truly independent court of justice for matters relating to subsidiarity , total transparency and economy and , most importantly , binding referendums .
It should be result-oriented and tied to objective and clear criteria on democratisation and the progress achieved in reforms .
This policy does not offer immediate results : it is a long-term mechanism .
So maybe we should take time to sit down and think , and should not charge like bulls into an easy-market concept .
If the Council is preparing such a mechanism , it will plunge countries into recession , leading to unemployment and favours for banks and big business .
However , I consider guaranteeing a system of abolitions for the health sector to be positive .
It would be massively damaging to the environment , destroying or polluting aquifers and releasing dangerous concentrations of asbestos and uranium from tunnel excavations .
As you have listened to the opinions here , you will agree with me that the most difficult issue we have to tackle is the issue of admissibility - how we can find a solution which would avoid the frustration of citizens , how we can protect EU values , and how we can keep this institute of the European Citizens &apos; Initiative serious and real .
Whilst creating an area of security , justice and freedom within the European Union is vital for us all , and certainly an example of the European democratic model that we are building , and while many of us consider Europol to be an instrument that can be adapted , we nevertheless all set great store by the fact that the pooling of resources - particularly human resources but also technical resources to fight organised crime and all kinds of trafficking - should be strictly controlled with a maximum guarantee of legal certainty , since we are striking at the very heart of our power : the rights and freedoms of European citizens .
Let us recall that the Council is about to sign the treaty on the European Stability Mechanism ( ESM ) which focuses on correction .
On the strength of a long tradition , national budgets , i.e. the taxpayer , support public TV broadcasters based on the assumption that public TV stations are there only to protect the public interest , while private broadcasters are there to protect private , commercial interests .
Given this , we are very justifiably concerned about the news which we recently received that the status of the Tibetan language as a language of instruction might be being weakened .
The role of cities , where 80 % of the European population lives , as sources of wealth creation , and as hubs of social and economic development is indisputable .
I also hope that the 5th World Water Forum will recognise the concept of water as a global public resource and that this idea will gain support , with consequent appropriate policies on its protection , on public ownership and on usage and distribution procedures .
( DE ) Mr President , Commissioner , I totally agree with you that we need a political solution , not a military solution in Sri Lanka .
Our government has collected considerable funds from taxes on all working people and has given them to Roma citizens in order to enable them to lead a dignified life .
I hope that we will not have the same ones again and again for five years , that they will change , and that we will be able to eliminate some and make progress , but in any event , we will organise this forum .
That has to be done and I hope that there will be a Commissioner responsible for both citizenship and communication from now on , and hopefully under the new Lisbon Treaty .
The need to establish a clear , comprehensive legal framework on the law applicable to divorce and legal separation arises out of an urgent need to address the problems that arise in the case of &apos; international &apos; divorces .
It will certainly not resolve all of the human rights problems in Turkmenistan , but it will help to ensure that international standards are complied with more fully , particularly in the areas of the rule of law and human rights .
in writing . - As I understood , this report deals with international investment treaties .
The positive suggestions included in the report are fatally coordinated , whether because of the Franco-German position , or because of the proposals for automatic penalties which were already present in the Commission &apos;s and Council task force &apos;s texts ..
One of the great scandals of the 20th century was the continuous and systematic chopping down of forests , especially in the Third World , done not by individuals who knew no better and cannot be faulted , but by big greedy businesses and corrupt governments .
It is estimated that there are between 4.5 and 8 million third-country nationals living illegally in the EU , generally finding work in the construction , agriculture , domestic work and hotel sectors .
I firmly believe that this approach would in practice actually improve conditions for workers and more importantly , would enhance the long-term prospects for Member States eventually to agree on scrapping exceptions altogether .
We need to get all these reforms right , so as to ensure that Europe as a whole and the euro area can meet future challenges with even greater capacity and conviction .
This is why I think that mentioning the Italian Prime Minister in your text filing lawsuits against Italian and European newspapers and not mentioning this case - I think what happened in Hungary is more serious - applies a double standard .
If a Member State suggests another approach , to remove an entity from the list or to add something , this is definitely a reason for revisiting this list .
We all know that the political process of approval has now been concluded in all Member States .
( ES ) Mr President , today , millions of individuals and millions of women the world over are shouting out against gender violence .
I support the principle expressed by our group , the Group of the European People &apos;s Party ( Christian Democrats ) , that the EU should not interfere in any national affairs for which it has no legal mandate to do so .
There has , therefore , been no cooperation , coordination or consistency whatsoever in the application of EU legislation .
( DE ) Madam President , I think it is important that Mrs Lagarde is appointed to this leading role .
Measures must be implemented for 2013 onwards that take the changed economic situation in Ireland , and particularly in the BMW region , into account .
I believe that we could be much more flexible and could review the Stability Pact , because we do not have a vision of the future European model .
The Commission also takes good note of the amendments .
I remember the situation at the start as being one in which Mrs Kroes presented an analysis showing that , despite several liberalisation packages at European level , the market power is held by fewer and fewer players - large energy companies - in ever more EU Member States , in other words the concentration is increasing in the energy sector in relation to electricity just as it is in relation to gas .
I agree with the measures and good practice proposed by Mr Mikolášik , and I believe that the proposal for broader application of core indicators is a particularly useful one , as is the preparation of reports on the results and synergies between national policies and European Union policies .
There should be no carte blanche for the Lukashenko regime .
The Europe 2020 strategy is intended to be the response to the current crisis .
I am also rather surprised that you in particular , Mr Brok , are now suddenly in favour of parliamentary control .
We know who their main victims are : the consumers with the lowest income , the most vulnerable consumers .
It is tremendous to actually see what is going on on the ground there with a view to accession : major political breakthroughs , but also , and above all , entirely practical changes that benefit the people who live there .
Tension between the individual states and Europe stems from this and is causing problems , and this is also increasing Europe &apos;s democratic deficit , which is only set to get worse in the absence of a coordinated policy on immigration ; it is heightening the impression that the self-interests of states prevail over the greater good .
Free trade and solidarity are often embraced here right up until we are to make a decision on them .
in writing . - ( NL ) I have voted against this report , because this UN Human Rights Council cannot by any stretch of the imagination be considered a legitimate institution .
I hope that the Commission will take a rather more determined position than the one shown here by the Commissioner .
Specific measures are thus going to be introduced to enhance the legal certainty , rights and information of bus and coach passengers .
For the moment we really have more urgent and more important questions to solve .
Congratulations !
I agree that the common agricultural policy should be adapted to the new conditions in order to better address the problems of food security , and this is why the removal of instruments which manage markets and a reduction in the level of EU expenditure on agriculture in the future financial perspective should be opposed .
It is time to fight for the harmonisation of social standards at a high level .
When it comes to financing the development of the poorest countries , I think that we should be careful not to perpetuate the single-crop farming trend , but to open up opportunities for the modern development of these countries .
First , this decision will give the green light to all those who are seeking a significant cost reduction in the manufacturing , transport and transit sectors .
Mr President , could I say on behalf of the ALDE Group that we would support Mrs Doyle &apos;s proposition ?
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , possibly the political situation in Moldova will relax tomorrow as a result of the election of a president supported by the Coalition for European Integration .
On the other hand , it is clear that the European perspective is a valuable tool and perhaps the only one available for maintaining a certain amount of pressure to ensure that the internal reform process in these countries continues , with regard both to the maturity of the market and the political system .
So , Commissioner , we look to you to be firm , fix these problems and come forward with solutions for SEPA direct debits by 30 September 2010 .
Mr President , in my first speech I had four minutes available and I only used up two .
For that reason , particular attention must be given to the drawing up of the 2020 strategy .
in writing . - I will be supporting this report because we have accepted Amendments 48 and 49 and rejected Amendment 93 in regard to recreational fishing .
We must not - and I would warn against doing this - alter the Solidarity Fund now on account of this incident .
If we do want to cut red tape , the gain from simplifying a procedure - insofar as this would have any noticeable impact on a business - must not be lost again through new obstacles elsewhere .
These fishermen , already severely affected by the crisis , will be the main victims of such a measure made necessary by illegal fishing and clandestine industrial networks .
Finally , we have introduced requirements for streamlined decision-taking .
Yet without equality and equality of treatment , you will never have freedom , you will never have security and you will certainly never have justice .
The Council and Parliament , or rather part of Parliament , were for excluding subcontracting entirely , but we have reached a compromise solution that I believe is workable : dual liability , which should not prevent us from legislating again on this issue in future .
Indeed , this is clear from everything we have learned up to now : complicated procedures , constraints on the topics and , if anything should emerge in the end , this is to be considered and , in particular , decided on in exactly the same eurocratic , rather undemocratic cenacles as before .
I believe that we should vote again on the Caspary report , for which there was just one amendment , and then not hold the final vote .
In Cuba , prosperity and self-initiative are clearly regarded as criticism of the regime .
rapporteur . - ( EL ) Mr President , this Council recommendation is very timely , because concerted action in the field of rare diseases is an absolute necessity , both at European Union level and at national level .
One crucial development issue is ending the deforestation of rainforests .
This is why we elected them - because we wanted to elect people who will make the traffic move for all European citizens to get a better life for themselves , and this is what they will do .
It is Parliament &apos;s obligation to be effective in resisting and combating the causes of poverty .
The problems in the EU fisheries and aquaculture sector should be solved in the context of the forthcoming review of the common fisheries policy .
Madam President , as a member of EuroLat , I commend the Spanish Presidency and Mr Salafranca for emphasising the importance of our relations with Latin America .
That is the price - the only price - at which the European Structural Funds will be distributed fairly and effectively .
Secondly , there is space for the exercise of discretion in anti-dumping procedures .
The ice cover has already shrunk by half .
That is why it is important that social safety nets in those Member States are not ignored .
I can think of many reasons why the situation is blocked .
However , it is not just a question of technical preconditions ; it is also a question of the political aspect of things .
More data could be gleaned from other areas .
Madam President , Commissioner , we have already held a debate about the ash cloud and the associated problems for aviation in the immediate aftermath of the volcanic eruption .
Subject : The possibility of a double-dip recession : sustainability of the 3 % target
Moreover , there is a way of achieving this : by radically changing the way that we produce and use energy in our society .
First of all we must intervene with all the vigour we can muster , and with all the help that we can offer in order to improve the democratic environment in these countries , and to strengthen democratic institutions in particular .
The Employment , Social Policy , Health and Consumer Affairs Council on 30 November last year , the informal EPSCO Council , the one that has just taken place in Barcelona , also said that the Member States and the Commission must work to ensure that , in accordance with their competence , the gender dimension can be consolidated in the 2020 strategy , and that all the relevant political fields are taken into account .
Although both the Lisbon strategy and the EU 2020 strategy attach greater emphasis than ever before to social policy , the issues of competitiveness and economic factors continue to take priority to the detriment of social issues .
The comprehensive institution-building programme envisaged by the Eastern Partnership is a case in point , as it specifically targets institutions within the Ukrainian Government which need strengthening in order to deliver on reform .
Today , we cannot accept Iran becoming a member of the highest authority for the defence of human rights .
Unfortunately the majority of these proposals are pending before the Council , so again we hope that the European Parliament will help us to put pressure on the Member States to actually move forward on these issues .
Member of the Commission . - Certainly , when I speak about the societal role of sport , matters concerning education and training are very important , and I think that education is even more important for our common European identity .
I have always believed that it is vital that Britain plays a committed role as a central player in the European Union .
It seems to me that when we are having to deal with challenges such as the economic crisis and the need to create growth , we should not be treating expenditure on the fight against global climate warming as a priority .
Finally , I would like to emphasise that it is fully compatible with , and complementary to , the proposal for a directive on the sustainable use of pesticides , which falls under the responsibility of my colleague , Commissioner Dimas .
We need concrete measures to increase people &apos;s feelings of safety .
In spite of its shortcomings , a temporary committee has been the right way to deal with a horizontal issue like this .
When we adopted this legislation , we did not decide on a clear and binding end date for migration to the SEPA instruments .
Yet here , too , the EU provides substantial technical assistance through the national and regional programmes of the European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument in support of the joint action plans under the European neighbourhood policy .
The lack of transparency in the negotiations of the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement ( ACTA ) are contrary to the spirit of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union .
There are young soldiers , such as Franek Wieczorka , head of the youth organisation called the Belarusian Youth Front , and Ivan Szyła , also from the organisation Young Front , who are being persecuted during military service , where they are cut off from access to information , and this is treated as a punishment .
In addition , by introducing supervision and monitoring of these funds , we can be sure that this will plug one of the gaps which still exist in Europe &apos;s financial supervision structure , thereby responding directly to the justified demands of European citizens who have been hit very hard by this financial crisis which has been triggered worldwide .
We therefore believe that the Commission should forward to the European Parliament the conclusions of the meetings and activities of the Joint Committee , together with the sectoral fisheries programme referred to in the protocol and the results of the relevant annual evaluations .
( CS ) Madam President , the directive on medicinal products has not been significantly amended for almost 10 years , and a revision of this directive is therefore long overdue .
An estimated 25 % of the global cocaine trade to Europe from Latin America comes through the Sahel region every year .
Finally - and this is my message for today - we still have to clean up the European banks .
Ukraine has the prospect of accession to the EU and we have the instruments to make that prospect a credible option .
Now , I have no choice but to repeat my question , because the new document does not say a word as to why this failure happened .
in writing . - In the resolution adopted by the EP , a specific chapter stresses the great importance of regions and local authorities in the consultation , information and implementation of the climate policy .
- Madam President , this is perhaps the most difficult issue for a free society .
The euro is a stable currency in the intercontinental competition between economic zones , but it is being destabilised from inside because there is no stable form of government .
I will only mention two : we have not yet properly finalised the details of ports of refuge and I hope that this does not lead to any dangers if we have any difficulties on our seas ; the other problem is the extension of passenger cover to inland navigation as well as the extension of domestic navigation .
A fundamental problem is the fact that the number of countries identified as LDCs is growing , while the number of countries which have developed sufficiently to be able to graduate from the group is as low as three .
His name was mentioned earlier , as well , although it is possible that your interpreter did not pass it on .
But traditional publications including posters , postcards and outdoor installations are also being prepared .
Regarding my report more specifically , with respect to trade there are currently a number of European countries whose imports of products largely offset the reductions in their own emissions .
My group favours adopting a thorough approach and taking as much time as necessary , even though you have once again offered very detailed answers to the questions regarding the acquis communautaire .
Billions of euros were found for the IMF and the World Bank , but for making that vital transition to a green economy there was no serious money on the table , just vague aspirations - just talks about talks .
On the other hand , I would like to state clearly that the recovery of the EU economy and financial stability must not lead to further supra-national tendencies , or fiscal federalisation , and must not become a pretext for the further transfer of powers from the national to the European level .
In January 2009 , the Commission published an interim report on the incentive fund process and sent it to all the institutions of the European Union , for whatever purpose it may serve .
The next item is the joint debate on combating terrorism and the statements by the Council and the Commission on body scanners and the operation of intelligence services in the context of counter-terrorism strategies .
Ethiopia &apos;s losses alone , which result from the fact that it is not possible to export flowers to Europe , amount to EUR 3 million a day .
There is a need for the Union to lead the international efforts for rehabilitation and reconstruction in this conflict area by initiating reconciliation projects , people-to-people programmes and contacts , and by sending a mission into the region once a political solution is found .
As a result of falling stocks of fish , there is a move to impose controls on shore angling and to deduct these catches from the quotas of the commercial fishing industry .
It should also be known that this mutual legal assistance agreement is at the heart of the SWIFT agreement , and any US request is subject to the authorisation of an EU judicial authority within that framework , so we have to keep working on it .
Rules on compensation for delays to international rail services are not enough .
The passage of time has not yet resolved these conflicts and neither has it healed wounds between the three nations that make up Bosnia Herzegovina .
There is nothing you can do to change this , but it gives Europe a negative image .
There is another initiative that is undoubtedly part of that set : the commitment to a new strategy for growth and the creation of high quality jobs .
Secondly , the purpose of managing the rotating Presidency is , perhaps not just acting as facilitator , but also as a driving force , as one of you said , so that our institutions can do their work .
In my opinion , it is the rapporteur and his committee against the rest of the world in this regard .
As I said , it was a request to defend his immunity .
( GA ) Mr President , I was glad to vote for this report , and I wish to commend my colleague and friend Mrs Kolarska-Bobińska on her achievement .
Moreover , our vote tomorrow will be a decisive step forward in the global campaign to ban the trade .
The other Member States show major budget deficits , and the fact that the Member States that were deaf to our request are now transferring these deficits is threatening the stability of our currency .
- Report : Lienemann
With the Lisbon Strategy , we have dismantled the social state .
There are great opportunities there to develop tourism right throughout the European Union , and I am quite happy to work with the Commission and to do anything we can because it is an opportunity .
Should Belarus &apos;s progress be great enough to warrant this , we are indeed ready to reciprocate and I hope that we could then really open up a new chapter in relations with Belarus .
The last question that was raised by Parliament related to the question of purchasing cooperatives .
In this context - the things underlined in the paper we adopted a few days ago : the European Union 2020 Strategy - we see no alternative to green growth .
( EL ) Mr President , as no debate is to be held on it in Parliament , I should like to highlight the importance to the European Union of the proposal for a Council directive implementing the Agreement concluded by the European Community Shipowners &apos; Associations and the European Transport Workers &apos; Federation .
Tehran is entitled to a nuclear programme used for peaceful purposes , but it is also obliged to restore the confidence of the international community that Iranian nuclear activity is exclusively peaceful in nature .
In its conclusion , the Council also invited the Commission to establish a high-level group on literacy and a thematic working group on maths , science and technology .
( CS ) Mr President , I listened attentively to Mr Verhofstadt , the Chair of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe , and I would like to ask him whether I am correct in thinking that his motto might be that Greece is everywhere , since Greece is not just a Member State of the European Union , but is actually a state of mind , and that Greece is therefore everywhere .
( PL ) Georgia and Armenia , and this is stressed by the authors of the report , are dynamically and successfully implementing a European strategy , a neighbourhood policy strategy .
in writing . - ( IT ) I voted in favour of Mrs Vlasto &apos;s report on port State control , which forms part of the third maritime package .
We are using the catch-the-eye procedure , so the blue-card procedure is not permitted .
I would like to conclude by making two rather provocative comments on the discussion as a whole .
I propose adoption of the directive , which will contribute to increased protection of the environment , operators and their surroundings when applying pesticides .
I will therefore vote in favour of this motion .
With regard to human rights , I did speak about human rights .
There is no doubt that we must ensure that exports that fulfil dual purposes are also used in a safe manner and cannot present a danger , but , in any case , we also have to question the excessive and unnecessary additional expenditure .
- Report : Pervenche Berès
Is it able to protect the EU &apos;s borders ?
I hope that I am wrong , but I do not think that it can work for the simple reason that it is a system of bilateral loans and not a system - a European solution - under which a single loan is made by the European Commission to Greece , which was the initial idea .
If followed up properly by the Member States , integrated policy action in these three fields , complemented by adequate monitoring as proposed by the Commission , will make a difference .
It is very important that an ambitious and legally binding agreement on climate change is reached at the Copenhagen conference .
If we simply doubled this , so that 20 per cent of SMEs made 30 per cent of that turnover in the internal market , we could achieve what we want .
Passive smoking is a huge problem , particularly for children .
For most of us here , it is a good thing that people - and perhaps even some of the Members here - can change their opinion if the circumstances change .
Customs officials stopped 32 million counterfeit medicinal products from entering the EU in 2008 .
This morning , many Members took part in the discussion and I believe that on this occasion , there were many more Members involved than usual .
By and large , that has been a very good story in these reports and this is very clear from the reaction that we have from Parliament &apos;s own report .
It is therefore no surprise that the proposed structure for the EEAS relegates the European Parliament to a secondary , irrelevant position in EU foreign policy , which my group and I firmly reject .
The Council is going to take the issue of the External Action Service forward .
Now I know that the leprechauns in UKIP , who attended the House last year following the previous referendum , have disappeared .
In response to the criticism made by the European Court of Auditors in the last ten years , the Commission has turned to the auditors - and this is recorded by the media - and asked them to change their methodology of work so that the report on EU expenditure would show a better figure .
As a result , it is vital to consolidate and improve indicators , thereby increasing Community know-how in this area , particularly as regards :
The OSCE reports , for example , that Turkey is blocking 3 700 Internet sites .
Protection against counterfeiting and the protection of intellectual property are undoubtedly an important element on an international scale .
In fact , it is policy as a whole that is being affected by the public debt crisis - the budgetary , economic , social , European , and national dimensions .
In conclusion , then , we have started this financing instrument on its way through successful compromise negotiations between the Council and Parliament and attempted to adapt it to the challenges of the future and to reach agreement on all the issues of content .
This could involve agriculture , but anyway , it is going to enhance whatever we do .
The most important amendments by the European Parliament considerably limit the scope of the directive and introduce elements of ambiguity and uncertainty which always operate for the benefit of the plutocracy and strengthen the unaccountability of capital .
Finally , the issue of the IMF &apos;s place within the United Nations system will also have to be raised , and if the Europeans do put forward a candidate , they must ensure that the mandate that they give to that person is structured in such a way as to enable him or her to push for a form of global governance that rises to the post-crisis challenges that we face .
This was a shame , as people in France have become aware in retrospect .
Our Parliament was and is the strong proponent of strong EU foreign policy .
It is , of course , true that many of those challenges remain in the national competences of the Member States but , at the start of the debate , I mentioned the two conferences .
I am sure , now as in the past , that the more complementary their activities and scopes are , the more effective they will be .
The possibility and ability to learn and work in an international context is a prerequisite for a successful working life in an ever more globalised economy .
However , we now need to take stock of the results achieved and carry on in the same direction .
After all , corruption is a topical issue in Cameroon .
Firstly , there is the issue of climate change .
This freedom is among the key European values and it cannot be called into question .
In order to correctly implement this and carry it out , clear quantifiable objectives must be set out for employment , education and poverty reduction .
The age limit of 65 years is a rule of the Staff Regulations that covers all categories of personnel working for the institutions , be they officials , temporary , contract or auxiliary staff , as well as parliamentary assistants , following the recent adoption of a new regulation in this respect .
I endorse this programme , but at the same time I would like to appeal to all of us and to our citizens to be attentive to the distress of the people around us .
It is estimated that nearly a fifth of women in Europe have been the victim of acts of physical violence at least once during their adult lives .
Furthermore , in my letters to the Environment Commissioner ( 10.1.2008 ) and the Commission President ( 22.5.2008 ) I have drawn attention to the urgent need to draw up a communication devoted specially and exclusively to the effective management of responses to earthquakes .
The list is endless , yet we watch and do nothing about this problem .
However , I believe that a Community working plan is needed for a minimum period of three years to set joint objectives and draw up a non-exhaustive list of product groups which will be considered as a priority .
( ES ) Mr President , I voted in favour of the reports on The Bahamas , Barbados , Saint Kitts and Nevis and Seychelles .
The first and foremost of them concerns citizens &apos; rights and fundamental freedoms .

Ladies and gentlemen , we have also discussed measures , cultural aspects , lawmaking and many other aspects of this complex issue .
I would therefore like to thank you for your willingness to adopt these laws so quickly .
What I am less pleased about is the way the Council works , as exemplified by the horse-trading between Mr Sarkozy and Mrs Merkel with a view to making the Commission &apos;s sound proposals less binding , which will mean that the proposal will not lead to any improvements .
I would draw your attention to a report voted through this Parliament on global food security , for which I was a rapporteur , which very clearly says that the market will not provide us with food security and certainly will not give farmers the income stability that they require .

They are strengthening the US / NATO plan for the &apos; broader Middle East &apos; with which the EU has agreed and the aim of which is for the imperialists to subjugate the entire region .

Allow me , Mr President , to address a final word to Commissioner Kovács , who is fighting his last battle this evening .
I know that the NPT also comprises civil elements , but we are not talking today about the renaissance of civil nuclear power ; we are talking about nuclear disarmament .

We welcome , in particular , the reference to the end of banking secrecy .
We are paying too little attention to one factor in this context and that is intensive farming , both in large-scale buildings and in certain regions .
We managed to clarify the measures which need to be taken when unauthorised substances are found either in EU-produced food or in food imported from third countries , as well as clarifying the basis for reviewing these reference points for action ( RPAs ) : that is , the maximum level established for control purposes for any unauthorised substance in the light of any new data .
By the end of the year - on 30 November in fact - we will put on the table our proposals for future funding programmes for research and innovation within the common strategic framework .

There is a large majority in Parliament and a majority on the Council , but unfortunately it is a minority on the Council that is allowed to decide that the opt-out must remain .

Therefore , I would ask very strongly that in talks with our Russian friends , we should emphasise , at all times and in every place , that incidents of this kind must not occur , because they make our dialogue together difficult , if not impossible .
In this connection , I should like to call on all my fellow Members to become involved in the initiatives from the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs , particularly as regards financewatch.org , so that in the future , we will actually be able to find ways of proceeding against the banks , against the lobbyists who are unfortunately still dictating matters here , and to get independent information .

When the Commission has similar analyses from all the countries of the Union , it will be able to select the strategy which is most advantageous for the European energy market .
I will get in touch with them about this .
Some of these subjects have also been included in the report of the main committee , the Committee on Culture and Education , which gives me hope that we have successfully achieved a complete report .
Unfortunately , too much time was wasted on protection , and not everything has gone smoothly .
I strongly reject accusations of European racism and xenophobia , because I am tired of watching illegal Tunisian migrants going on strike because they are not being given money to buy cigarettes , refusing to eat food containing tuna because it smells of fish , and , once in Italy , demanding housing and work ( for free , of course ) , when we have our own indigenous unemployed and poor people .
The Greens hope that the EU Energy Summit will also address this crucial issue .
Many people there make a living from the drugs trade and this , of course , is something that must change .

Fourthly , we also believe that a certain increase is justified on account of the Treaty of Lisbon .
This is counterbalanced , however , by Parliament &apos;s introduction of the regulation of nanoparticles and thus the application of the precautionary principle .
When the Commission published its original proposal , many of the manufacturers made it clear that they wished to settle for nothing less than 160g CO2 / km , a figure which , in turn , struck most of us in Parliament as being far too relaxed and complacent .

These conclusions stress that we must draw lessons from the disaster in Japan , and that we must review the safety condition of the EU &apos;s nuclear power plants and conduct the stress tests .
Thirdly , one of the basic reasons why I voted against the motion is the reference to Bandera .
That is where the hopes lie that we will put an end to this , that we will make a policy for full employment , for quality jobs , for jobs that are inclusive for all , and that we will finally make Europe &apos;s objective excellence rather than the fight to lower social standards .
Similarly , we do not like to pay too much as a result of a dishonourable deal between businesses .
Finally , exemptions have been provided for small and medium-sized enterprises who have informed us of the threats that would have hung over their business if the text had been too strict .

I would like to congratulate the rapporteur for her contribution and stress that as a minimum income is desirable ; setting the amount should be the responsibility of each Member State .
The decision to increase the resources of the new Multiannual Financial Framework by 5 % will guarantee the stability of existing programming cycles and new investment in areas such as European energy and transport networks , which will allow Europe to defend its competitiveness and prepare the ground for long-term economic growth .
We cannot eliminate it , but we must manage it .

I was asked whether the World Bank and other international institutions can help countries where there is substantial poverty being created as a result of the crisis .
Obviously , this should never have been allowed to happen .
In this context we would cooperate and in this context we would support Mr Cohn-Bendit &apos;s motion .
This supervisory role will guarantee a truly democratic control of the service , which is of paramount importance to me .
There are nanoparticles in medicine , but we know very little about their toxicological effects .
My point is that trade agreements can achieve the benefits of EU trade without the burden of high regulatory costs , loss of sovereignty and of resources .
The Commission proposal therefore requires significant corrections to diversify the sectors involved , including the production and exports of Pakistan , accepting a different vision and a serious reflection on the respect for human rights and the fight against terrorism .
We must not end up in the situation where there will be surplus energy available on the European energy market , because this will not be purchased due to the high prices .
Nevertheless , many countries have adopted these restrictive measures , countries with different economic bases such as the United States , China , Argentina , Russia and Indonesia , but also many developing countries .

Faced with these problems , the Peillon report has been drafted in the only way possible , highlighting , on the one hand , that the conflicts must not hinder tangible progress towards multilateral cooperation in specific sectors , while acknowledging , on the other , that the Union for the Mediterranean will not be fully successful unless these conflicts are settled .
I shall end with a particularly important issue raised , that of consumer information .
The disproportionate membership bill would be better steered towards funding economic development through self-sufficiency determined by the UK itself .

Allow me to add a few words on maternity protection , because our position has been very badly misunderstood .

My question to the Commission is : has an overall evaluation of this instrument been carried out ?
During its first years of existence , the euro had to face three major trials : the establishment of a sound and credible central bank , the creation of a stable new currency and inspiring confidence .

It is also foreseen that the draft implementing measure states that the Commission will examine the GHG intensity of other categories of feedstock with high greenhouse gas emissions and , if scientifically warranted , the implementing measure will be amended through the addition of new feedstock categories .
It is important as a political commitment to promoting and guaranteeing social standards and to adapting the legal and institutional mechanisms to the specific standards and values of European democracies .
It seems to me that Europe can only congratulate President Obama on his decision to close the detention centre , something that many of us have been demanding for several years .
In accordance with the Commission &apos;s assessment , which , after thorough examination , we are also able to support , the applications fulfil the eligibility criteria set .
By retabling our amendments aimed at a fairer application of a reduced VAT rate - especially , for example , on children &apos;s clothes in the new Member States , so as to put them on the same footing as the older ones - we wanted to send a strong message to the Commission and the Council .
( HU ) I read the following in a European Union White Paper in 1996 : a fierce global battle is expected in the coming decades between Europe , the United States , Japan and the emerging Asian countries .

In Europe , 16 % of citizens still live below the poverty line , and the accessibility of food remains a key issue to be dealt with .
We support the criticisms and observations made by the rapporteur as regards the need to implement an effective recovery system .

The case of Ales Mikhalevich , one of President Lukashenko &apos;s opponents , who was tortured during his pre-trial detention , and that of journalist Natalia Radina are significant in a current situation which we are duty-bound to counteract by supporting the efforts of civil society in Belarus , the independent press and the opposition to encourage democracy .
They should explain who is doing this , namely Muslim fanatics , and why they are doing it - because of the intolerant and violent fault lines in Islamic ideology .

I welcome this Chamber &apos;s decision to follow the guidelines of the Committee on Budgets and the Member States , which are often forced into debt following excessive EU cash advances .
We are also saying &apos; no &apos; to the criminalisation of dissent in local communities , and therefore &apos; yes &apos; to legality .
However , we believe that in some cases , it makes more sense to spend a euro at European level than at national level because of the potential benefits of exploring the European dimension and the European internal market .
( FR ) Mr President , the great Catholic philosopher Chesterton said that the modern world was full of Christian ideas gone mad .

I would like to invite the Members of the European Parliament to take into consideration the following observations on the issues raised in the draft EP report .
I would like some enlightenment , and you are far more expert in the Rules of Procedure than I am , sir .
Each passing day proves this : the separation of the infrastructure from the business of transport imposed by the directives so as to enable the system to be opened up to brutal competition is a technical and organisational nonsense that is costly both to taxpayers and to users .
The dual system of broadcasting is an answer to Europe &apos;s media landscape which must be safeguarded on all platforms .
It is reasonable and appropriate that we should work together in these areas so that we can tackle the Commission together in a positive sense and get the relevant responses within the required timeframe .
I believe that when we participate in finding a solution in this manner , we are performing our work in the best possible way .
These are anti-social , irresponsible actions and we cannot blame the Commission for them .

There are people who are afraid of the Internet , people who do not understand its development or its interest .

The Mediterranean must remain the link between our civilisations rather than a place of misery and desolation .
There are , across Europe , many worries and concerns , but there are also , across Europe , high expectations that the reforms , postponed for far too long , will finally be completed , that the European dimension will be an integral part of the solution , and that Europe will defend its projects , its values and its interests in the world .

The statistics show that the programme only alleviates the problem of malnutrition but is not eliminating it .

No sooner had it been adopted - what is more , unanimously - this excellent report was buried completely .

In order to build this political Europe , Mr Barroso , two pitfalls must be avoided in our view .
All Member States will hopefully have learned the lessons of the crisis , namely that a balanced budget and strong fiscal discipline are rewarded by lower funding costs in the financial markets , and that honesty in statistical reporting is essential for continued market confidence .
For these reasons , the approach that I took , supported by our shadows , in formulating Parliament &apos;s position , was to strongly support the aim of improving the completeness , relevance and comparability of the statistics on offer in this field , bringing the statistics more up to date with new trends in the tourism sector to reflect , for instance , the increase in Internet bookings and in short-stay trips .
One exception soon becomes many , and I cannot deny Mr Schulz the floor .
We have a directive on privacy and electronic communications , a lot of concrete action or action plans , a European programme on protection of critical infrastructures .
I voted in favour of this report because I argue that research makes a fundamental contribution to economic growth , to job creation and to environmental sustainability .
Additionally , it would be a serious setback in many areas to stop to cultivate the land , both in terms of vital rural income and the loss of landscape , which might have been formed during several centuries .
We in the West do not have a monopoly on the capitalism on which the old European model was built .
Please make these savings !
The EU &apos;s commitments , voiced by Commissioner Barrot , provide us with the guarantee that from March , we will have an excellent legal framework .
What we would like to do , and what I would like to see , is that GBP 48 million a day being kept in the United Kingdom and spent on essential public services , and not handed over , when the EU &apos;s accounts have not been audited for 14 years .
Finally , to sum up , I am delighted with the compromise reached in the negotiations and I obviously cannot but recommend that you adopt it at today &apos;s vote and I wish the citizens &apos; initiative all the success that it is predicted to have .
As someone from the continental mainland , I also observed that these farmers in the outermost regions of the Union do face a special set of circumstances .
Therefore , I sincerely wish the Czech Republic success meeting new challenges and leading the European Union up to the middle of this year .
Mr President , yesterday in Ireland , a conference addressed the topic of aid and Eastern Europe .
People in this age group bring added value to the world of work , and therefore preparatory measures should be taken to involve them more .
This outcome will strengthen the EU &apos;s negotiating position in international trade talks , especially in the ongoing Doha negotiations of the World Trade Organisation .
As chairman of the delegation for relations with Iran and spokeswoman on foreign policy , I would also say that anyone who has not learned from the Iran crisis over recent years , which has often put us in danger of military escalation , that the civil use of nuclear power cannot be divorced from military abuse and proliferation , has failed to understand the entire foreign policy of recent years , the dangers and our nuclear disarmament challenge .
I beg you to vote against all amendments tabled to this joint motion supported by these four groups and support the motion as it has been agreed by these four groups that are of very different political stances .
There are 111 State Parties to the ICC , with some regions under-represented , such as the Middle East , North Africa and Asia .
( PL ) Mr President , the European Union has an ageing population and the percentage of people suffering from age-related diseases is rising .
It must construct the &apos; EU regional political partnership for peace , security and development in the Horn of Africa &apos; which the Committee on Development launched when it adopted its report in April 2007 .
Flows of waste electrical and electronic equipment are increasing in the European Union .
Unfortunately , instead of replacing that monolith by going on to genuine democratic socialism , it was the restoration of capitalism which followed .
Apart from the earthquake , the absence of institutions and good governance is a huge problem at the moment .
I would like to ask you to reconsider this .
The reason it has been so long coming , of course , is that there are problems with various details - major details we could say - namely , the question of generic medicines , which the previous speaker also mentioned .
EU statistics show that in Lithuania , single mothers face the greatest risk of poverty .
This scandal shows that , far from having settled this matter , they have opened up a new can of worms that will see us become a little more overwhelmed in trade terms not only in the area of bananas , but also with regard to other agricultural products .
Then , the other issue relates to the relationship and consistency between the various policies , because the Commission clearly tells us that it has fundamentally changed things in this 2020 strategy , since it has reduced the number of targets .
That is why I personally had a hand in drafting this resolution calling on the European Commission to be extremely responsive .
The European Commission and the European Council should pass more general decisions in order to prevent the same thing happening again in future .
The vote will take place tomorrow ( Thursday , 24 March 2011 ) .
The new trading regime which will govern relations between the European Union and APC countries should ensure that all these countries are integrated into the international trading system , into the global economy , an economy which is going through an unprecedented crisis , a crisis which is affecting both developed and developing countries and emerging economies .
You must agree , Mr President , that no policy can be effective if it is not backed or , at the very least , tolerated by society .
I feel that it would be beneficial to begin international negotiations on convergent competition rules worldwide , given that many agreements and practices are covered by different competition regimes , which prevent stakeholders from competing in the market on a level playing field .
Perhaps it is part of the legislator &apos;s responsibility to talk with these players and to demand some sense of responsibility from them .
If we follow that prescription of a rigid return to the Stability Pact criteria by the end of 2013 , it will be a recipe for huge cuts in public spending and public provision , unemployment will rise , tax takes will be reduced , and we will enter a period of sluggish growth that could lead to a real reduction in the economic potential of the European Union for many years to come .
This dialogue must continue but it must also be made clear that we will be very firm : firm in defending human rights and firm towards the outrages being committed through the adoption of laws in relation to NGOs .
We are now paying for mistaken judgments within the European Union institutions .
Supermarket chains very often impose unfair conditions and make it difficult for farmers and small suppliers to access the market .
As you know , the Presidency and Parliament &apos;s representatives managed to reach an agreement concerning this proposal and the European Parliament adopted the regulation yesterday .
Another thing that we can do to stimulate demand and to help and lead the motor industry through this crisis is to ensure that the conditions of international competition , too , are also not violated .
That is why I welcome the fact that Parliament , the Council and the Commission have , at the first reading , agreed to a quick extension of the deadlines for the Biocides Directive , until - I think , Commissioner , - 2014 .
The resolution under discussion is a helpful contribution to the process : it delivers the right messages to Iceland at the right moment .
We are currently facing a refugee crisis in the area and many regimes are turning on their own people .
I should like to welcome most warmly the President of the Council , the Prime Minister of the Czech Republic , Mirek Topolánek , to the European Parliament .
No one is preventing us from drawing up another resolution , as I said , on economic issues .
As far as the debate on rendition flights and its implications for EU aviation policy are concerned , the Commission draws some lessons in the context of the communication of civil and business aviation from January 2008 .
In other words , we care for Moldova and its citizens .
We are the largest donor to the least developed countries in the world ; we have trebled aid in the last few years , but poverty has increased , not decreased .
The financial resources of EU Cohesion Policy for the period 2007-2013 can significantly help to fulfil the objectives of the EU &apos;s renewed Lisbon Strategy for growth and employment , which brings together ordinary people , companies , infrastructure , the energy sector and research and innovation .
I therefore congratulate the rapporteur for his excellent work and hope that we will all be healthier and will have easier access to information .
As announcements of this sort and the time at which they are made feed speculation , what comments does the Commission have on the situation in the Greek banking system ?
I am grateful that the focus here is on small and medium-sized enterprises in particular .
That has led to confusion and a consistent postponement of deadlines .
Our efforts here to obtain as much money as possible for the European funds are in vain if , in our home countries , the powers that be do not take the measures required to access and use the funds efficiently .
Of course , it remains a quite clear demand for us that we in the European Union in any case need a legal framework to protect services of general economic interest .
In times of crisis , every economic field is in a precarious situation , and airline transport is no exception to that .
However , this agreement is giving rise to serious threats , which are alarming the public , and the Commission must , of course , be aware of this .
We condemn both those murders , and we can only hope that the rival parties in Guinea-Bissau will find the necessary will and power to resolve their disputes through dialogue at the negotiating table for the sake of their citizens &apos; well-being .
This is something that I do not agree with and find unacceptable .
This explains my support for the immediate fulfilment of obligations undertaken at the G20 summit in Pittsburgh on the matter of a shift in the IMF quota share to emerging and developing countries of at least 5 % , and an increase of at least 3 % in voting power in the World Bank for developing and transition countries .
Thank you , colleagues , for being active during the last hour .
A more accurate estimation of the costs of examining the applications submitted would be facilitated if we had such an estimate , which would enable us to conduct an appropriate debate in the Council .
Let us focus on the examples given in some quotes from the report , such as on the area of energy , for example : &apos; points out the importance of a fully operational internal market for energy &#91; ... &#93; ; stresses that the internal energy market should contribute to maintaining energy prices affordable for both consumers and businesses &apos; .
Today , we have approved further steps for launching version two of the Schengen Information System , which reinforces security guarantees for all Europeans living in a unified space without barriers .
That said , the Commission can act in these situations only when we have the right legal basis on which to do so .
Of the 50 proposals presented by the Commission , I would like especially to highlight the steps taken to ensure increased competitiveness of SMEs , easier access to credit and to internationalisation , so that they can seize the new investment opportunities offered by the global market .
Just as catastrophic floods on the Nile brought fertility in ancient Egypt , the global crisis should be an impulse for the development of new European cars that are more environmentally-friendly and highly competitive on world markets .
The European Union has already adopted the ambitious objective of a 20 % reduction in CO2 emissions by 2020 during the French Presidency in 2008 .
Unfortunately , in a number of countries , both within the EU and beyond , the environment and environmental requirements are often not a priority when planning , building and operating installations that have a significant impact on the environment .
This is why I wanted to link the very finest of sport and what sportsmen and women do to get to the condition they are in , while also encouraging those at lesser levels of sport to understand that taking a quick drink is not going to make you the best sportsperson in the world .
The tragic accident in Japan has led to a nuclear disaster that is now familiar to us all .
It seems to be that you have to look for an explanation in the foundational DNA of the two polities .
The Commission is to investigate whether State aid , if this is forthcoming , complies with strict conditions .
Thanks to a public outcry , the Facebook site was quickly taken down but not before over a thousand members in a single month between December 2008 and January 2009 had signed up .
In order to give a timely follow-up to this , I organised a pledging conference a month ago .
A policy of prevention that uses the most appropriate foreign policy instruments , with a view to tackling and confronting the causes of instability , could help to transform the current &apos; desperate necessity &apos; for emigration into an &apos; opportunity &apos; for emigration .
It is very important , as honourable Members have said , that we continue to look at the way in which we conclude agreements and the tools at our disposal to do that and to make sure that those levers are pulled if necessary .
Liberalisation of the visa requirements that apply to citizens of the Western Balkans is an important measure that will strengthen ties between this region and the European Union .
In autumn 2008 , shortly after his election , US President Obama reaffirmed his goal to create a US-wide carbon market .
We are talking here about the European social model that we want and that we love .
Together with Parliament , the Commission intends taking a new initiative very shortly vis-à-vis the Council and its Spanish Presidency , to unblock the dossier .
These differences are apparent here in Parliament as well .
Apart from strengthening our political relations , we will propose that the new agreement with Georgia should include the creation of an expanded , comprehensive free trade area .
Finally , I wish just one thing for you and for Belgium , and that is that we finally get to see the proficiency at Federal level in Belgium that you have shown at European level following the sound thinking that whoever has to make demands - as you did - must also demonstrate solutions .
I would ask you therefore in your wisdom to rule that these amendments are admissible , but that those concerning the function of the Bureau - the number of vice-chairs for committees and so on - are clearly not matters relating to Lisbon and should not be voted on this week .
Another positive point to mention is the automatic payment of outstanding wages to the workers .
We are encouraged by President al-Bashir &apos;s remarks in Juba on 4 January , reaffirmed at the Mini-Summit on Sudan in Addis Ababa on 31 January , that the Government of Sudan will accept the results of the referendum , will be the first to recognise the new state and will extend full cooperation to it .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , today we are , in fact , once again debating a proposal for the mobilisation of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund .
The European Union is facing its greatest challenges since its formation .
What is most important at this moment is that the EU finds a way of liberalising the entry visa regime .
No , we cannot be silent : we must be proactive ; otherwise we condone these kinds of events in the world .
The report on the second strategic review of energy policy shows far too little in the way of cohesion .
( SL ) Mr President , there are , indeed , thousands of victims in Japan and I personally deeply sympathise with them and think that the European Union should offer all possible assistance .
Madam President , so far we have dealt with the crisis but now we need to deal with the fundamental problems that caused the crisis - namely the large deficits and the weak public finances .
It takes time .
This is our intention .
The opt-out , originally devised for the UK , became an opt-out that 14 other countries progressively needed to use , and we heard from the Czech Presidency today that at least two others are now joining that group .
But what the sceptics fail to understand is that the G20 process itself is spectacular news ; it is not like our European , more integrated process where everyone round the table shares a common culture of negotiation and compromise .
In addition , this proposal must not remain isolated .
I would also point out that this directive is part of the framework of the European Union &apos;s common immigration policy .
Unscrupulous employers benefit from these illegal workers who are prepared to work for very poor rates and in dangerous conditions .
I congratulate Mr Hökmark on preparing such a topical report on the radio spectrum policy programme .
Despite the fact that we have asked the Member States and other institutions to make cuts , we have doubled the expenditure in a number of areas for the European Parliament itself and for the EU institutions in general .
The fact is , at a time when the Treaty of Lisbon is being pitched so strongly to us , we can only be surprised that you should want to enforce this Article 186 of the regulation , which will give you full powers .
Finally , I would like to highlight , as has been rightly done by Mrs Wallis and Mr Medina Ortega , the importance of the national courts in the application of Community law .
However , the state must not sink to the level of the terrorists .
This has been a joint and collaborative exercise and I am extraordinarily grateful to all of you for the work that has gone on .
In Poland , we have started a debate on the subject of priority in politics .
Moreover , Serbia &apos;s potential accession , just like the visa waiver , will lead to even more emigration into Western Europe , emigration that will be of no benefit to us .
If people are struggling with employment , housing , food or health , we must help them - that is what solidarity means .
In this context , new Member States , which are much more vulnerable to external disruptions to their energy supply , need the support of the European Union to tackle these challenges .
Thank you , Mrs Alfano .
On the one hand , the EU and Russia share common international commitments , as I said , through the instruments that we have signed together at the UN , at the OECD and at the Council of Europe .
The economic crisis has unsettled and is still unsettling Europe .
I will take it into account .
As regards application , if we consider the number of infringement procedures , there is , objectively speaking , a well-known problem , in other words , a lack of independence of the regulatory and appeals bodies , even where there is functional or institutional separation , and this separation may also entail other issues and costs relating to internal coordination .
I am pleased that the EU is sending a clear signal through the &apos; Union of Innovation &apos; programme regarding the importance of innovation for maintaining the economic position of Europe in global competition .
simplification of the eligibility of expenditure ;
The proposal aims to enhance the role of regulatory authorities by ensuring that the Member States provide them with adequate authority , competence and human and financial resources to fulfil their responsibilities .
It is Hungary &apos;s historic responsibility to see that under the Hungarian Presidency , we do not speed up but rather prevent this dangerous process .
That is not compassion : that is stinking hypocrisy .
I did not obtain a majority at the Conference of Presidents - we are a democratic Parliament here - and we have therefore tried to prepare this resolution .
As a result , the question arises as to whether a strengthened European Parliament in cooperation with a weak Commission can actually do any positive work in terms of integration and satisfying the interests of the European peoples .
We can clearly see that focusing on public finances alone will not help us resolve the crisis .
All our citizens can apply directly to the European Commission to submit a legislative proposal .
Congratulations on your report , Mrs Pagano .
For a long time Europe and the United States have shared common challenges and even common enemies , although some , particularly on this side of the Atlantic , would hesitate to acknowledge this .
We also need this signal urgently , and this money , too , is within the 2010 budget .
We will ensure that these objectives are reached through our future legislative work , and you have mentioned that .
Bureaucratic lethargy and legislative delays cannot and must not crush a child &apos;s dreams and hopes of having a family and a happy future .
Another very important matter is the search for new sources of protein - this is a very good route towards the independence of European agriculture .
The Copenhagen conference on climate change was disappointing .
Let me conclude by reiterating that this negotiation is very important and , I believe , an opportunity we should not miss .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , tomorrow , you will adopt the resolution on the 2010 progress report on the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia .
For example , under the previous , the third , Community Support Framework , numerous Member States took up Community funds for that purpose .
For these reasons , it is vital that there should be swift implementation of this Framework Agreement , and it is important to recognise the need for constant evaluation in order to improve the efficiency and efficacy of this institutional relationship .
The European Commission will continue to play a proactive role in contributing to global food security and the McGuinness report has certainly been a good analysis to look at some possible avenues which could be considered by the EC and the broader international community .
However , no matter how important oil and gas are , they are not everything .
After rejecting all the amendments from first reading attempting to introduce delegated acts into the instruments , without proposing any alternative procedure , the Council called for Parliament to adopt its position without leaving any scope for negotiations .
Many here spoke about that today .
The fall in the number of employees and companies has a powerful impact on the budgets allocated for public expenditure , as well as on European citizens &apos; quality of life .
Unfortunately , however , in the report by the European Parliament which we are examining today , my country is presented as the only country responsible for the delay in opening negotiations .
At present , both the issue of energy transit and market accessibility are fraught with contradictions .
It must also provide security for tomorrow .
I was rapporteur , as you know , on the UN Convention on behalf of the European Parliament in 2003 as the UN Convention was being drafted .
As the honourable Members rightly pointed out in their questions , the European Council and the European Parliament reached agreement on the political content of the decision as a result of the aforementioned informal meetings .
( CS ) The draft resolution on the outcome of the Copenhagen Summit on climate change was the result of the detailed work of Members from a number of committees and is linked to the long-term strategy of a genuine green policy in keeping with the economic goals of the EU in a globalised world .
That is why we should increase the protection offered to vessels of this type .
I believe that such a method will lead to further disasters .
The European Union should be leading the peace process , and should be the main force striving for peace in the Middle East .
Perhaps I would have done certain things differently , but it is Hungary &apos;s right to do things as it sees fit .
Every day one of your electorate loses his job , and three more worry that they will suffer the same fate .
When we talk about violence against women , we are discussing something that is clearly a reality in all the Member States , as one in four women is a victim of violence .
On the subject of Growth , Investment and Job Creation , this Summit emphasised the need to create economic growth , capable of generating employment , alongside sustainable social development .
We know that online shopping is a contemporary phenomenon , but that the laws that govern it are behind the times , and now it is time to move on .
I am absolutely sure that there is no conflict of interest .
It does not really work as something brought in from the outside , and that is why I would like to emphasise the importance of including civil society in the process , because that way , democracy grows organically , as it were : from the grassroots of society .
We are not talking about the specific funds that are paid out , but rather a ceiling , and below this ceiling there must be scope for us to be able to deal with new challenges .
As we know , the budget represents the start of any political act .
This is not a bailout but a sell-out : a sell-out , at EU insistence , to bondholders - senior , junior , secured , unsecured - every type , category and class of bondholder , while Irish taxpayers shoulder intolerable debt .
The floods in fact caused serious damage to the landscape and to the people living in the five regions affected .
You as politicians can send a clear message to politicians .
In the case of Sri Lanka , the Commission &apos;s attention was drawn to publicly available reports and statements from the United Nations as well as to other relevant sources , including non-governmental organisations , indicating that Sri Lanka was not effectively implementing various human rights conventions , in particular , the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights , the Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel , Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment , and the Convention on the Rights of the Child .
Through resettlement , the Member States of the European Union can demonstrate tangible solidarity with these often over-burdened countries of first asylum , at the same time protecting some of the most vulnerable refugees under sustainable and humane conditions .
Along those lines , we should look towards establishing a true confederative transatlantic body between us and the United States of America .
( ES ) Madam President , I would like to congratulate everyone on this initiative , because it means improving the life expectancy of many people and making solidarity and fraternity into something more than just words .
In addition , micro-credits can already be granted under the European Social Fund , and also under the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund .
This morning I would like a wake-up call .
In these circumstances , we believe that we should wait for the assessment and recommendation by experts , following the situation closely in 2010 .
As I asked one of your colleagues before , could I have assurances now , as we approach the critical meeting that will be the UNFCC COP-15 in Copenhagen this December , that we will have the enthusiastic support of the Czech Government for an adequate and fully equitable global agreement to reduce carbon emissions worldwide ?
An aid package is being prepared , to be launched at the earliest possible opportunity .
Consequently , they also wish to see European workers continuing to deal with these cars in the future .
I assume that Europe will still be a strong player on the world stage at that point but , for that to happen , we really have to keep up the momentum of the past six months .
Israel has taken a first step with its temporary and partial settlement freeze .
And , regarding your second question , I am pleased to confirm that the Commission is fully committed to working towards an effective and early transposition of the Ship Recycling Convention into EU legislation .
If we persist in making unilateral requests that Europe should reduce its emissions by much greater amounts than those provided for by the Kyoto Protocol , then the next summit in Cancún - the COP16 - will also be a failure and , once again , Parliament will look terrible .
The gas crisis which we have just survived has clearly demonstrated once again how important a secure , reliable and cheap energy supply is for the EU .
It must condemn the brutal aggression , crimes , violations of the most basic human rights and state terrorism perpetrated by Israel against the Palestinian people , which nothing can justify .
Mountains , which make up 40 % of European territory and are home to 90 million people , have , up to now , been seen as disadvantaged areas : by implementing innovative and consistent energy policies , these regions can overcome this handicap and provide a vital stimulus to achieve the objectives set in the 20-20-20 strategy , showing that energy selfsufficiency is possible , at an acceptable cost , if the firm political will is there .
However , there are illegal shipments of this waste outside the EU , which reinforces the important role of Member States in the monitoring and inspection of collection and processing .
I am concerned that the costs of inputs have risen .
The vote will take place on Wednesday , 20 October at 12 : 30 .
Therefore , this report is the result of the compromise which we had been seeking .
I want to make that clear , because at this point , we will not be debating the content of the issues in question .
The demands on local and regional authorities and on private home-owners to carry out energy refurbishments of their properties are particularly pointless , given the financial situation of all the parties involved .
As far as an alternative to SIS II is concerned , the JHA Council in February welcomed the completion of the feasibility study serving as a basis for creating a workable , alternative technical scenario for developing SIS II based on SIS I + evolution as a part of the contingency plan .
I have backed the report also because it includes a request for the Commission to publish lists of the non-governmental organisations that have applied its proposals during the legislative preparations .
For instance , it is essential to provide education in general EU and citizenship knowledge in open universities or as part of secondary school curricula .
Given that , last year , this position gave rise to a great deal of misunderstanding and that this is also very important in the international negotiations , the EU intends to adopt a flexible stance : flexible with regard to a second commitment period , but subject to the fulfilment of certain conditions .
An awakening to more in the way of safety , stability and prosperity for women , including without the burka , seemed to be within reach .
This should be very much taken into account when it comes to setting the next budgetary framework .
I am absolutely delighted that the vast majority of the European Parliament has today approved the report on the European Microfinance Facility for Employment and Social Inclusion .
Thirdly , the resources are woefully inadequate , especially when compared with those deployed by the US government , for example .
However , as far as I am aware , none of the EU Member States has recognised Taiwan .
Our intention is that the summit should ask the Energy Council to intensify EU-US cooperation on the development and deployment of green energy technologies and promote exchanges between our researchers to allow them to participate freely in each other &apos;s energy research programmes .
I should , in fact , like to hear a few scientifically-backed proposals which are designed to secure the future viability of populations of bluefin tuna , but which also take account of the viability of European fishermen and their families .
I support this report since the circumstances in which the 2011 budget will be adopted will be exceptional due to the Treaty of Lisbon coming into force and the continuing economic and financial crisis .
I think we , as the European Union , have a duty to make the fight against exclusion and poverty one of our priorities .
in writing . - I visited the horticulturalist producer Johnson of Wixley in my constituency last week , where they expressed concerns about some elements of the recent pesticides package , particularly the strict cut-off criteria on certain pesticides where there are , as yet , no substitutes .
We need to keep pressing for democratic freedoms and standards , freedom of expression , democratic values , while at the same time patiently giving Belarus the green light as a country and a society we would like to see draw closer and closer to the European Union .
We expect the new Commission to carry out the mid-term review quickly , as , under the terms of the agreements made in 2006 , this should have been submitted by 2009 at the latest , in other words , by the end of this year .
Furthermore , we do not believe that the Stability and Growth Pact is in crisis .
I would like to ask the Commission how this agreement is going to reflect both the European Union &apos;s future industrial policy and India &apos;s industrial policy .
One area of the Commission &apos;s proposal which all groups agreed was unworkable concerned the very complex issue of multi-stage vehicles .
The bill of indictment states that the company has been involved in a long-term bribery process .
It is important for the European sports movement and activities at grassroots level that the Member States can preserve their national gambling systems .
As regards youth policy , where subsidiarity is the rule , we must encourage the Member States to define common objectives and agendas , and to improve their cooperation and their exchange of good practice .
The causes of the crisis can only be eliminated through structural reforms .
A peculiar kind of optimism is emerging everywhere in Europe , even though unemployment is on the increase , national economies are running into debt , the population is ageing , and a sort of triple guillotine is hanging over Europe , and despite all that , the recession has been declared over .
This is a joint proposal by five political groups .
The way to do this is to support the Tibetan request to restart the Chinese-Tibetan talks and to recognise that , if anyone has spent years giving way to and being pressurised by the Chinese authorities , then in this case it is the Tibetan people .
And , finally , could I say that I believe it should be possible to enable citizens to register on the Internet .
The Czech Republic , which took over the Presidency of the European Union Council on 1 January 2009 , is facing , along with other states which joined the EU in 2004 and later , problems linked to the precarious state , in terms of thermal insulation , of a large number of residential buildings .
We already have quite intensive political consultation in the Council when it comes to showing solidarity , but this is also a question of political will .
I am thinking , for example , of agriculture - our Indian colleagues spoke to us about this - and of the consequences for sectors that are particularly exposed to competition from emerging countries in Europe , and I am thinking of the car industry .
These millions of Iranians , inside and outside the country , expect something from us and , therefore , the starting point cannot be anything other than that of solidarity and of collaboration in aiding these millions of Iranians , who are fighting for democracy and for human rights and who , it should be pointed out , are running risks much greater than those normally feared by diplomacy .
We will do the same in plenary and we express our sincere hope that this small step forward will constitute a new turning point in European policy on this matter .
Young children must be together with their family to benefit from the direct supervision and care of their parents .
Fourthly , last week , I took part in the Conference of Speakers of the European Union Parliaments in Stockholm .
Madam President , I would like to thank those who worked on these two important reports .
This is not on the first vote but a vote on the second page .
Debate on a common patent for the entire Union has been going on for a long time .
I voted for this report because I am pleased that we are making a strong statement , without loopholes , on the trade in seal products in the EU .
I am confident that this will continue to be the case in jumping this final hurdle to seeing the Treaty enter into force after the strong support given to the Lisbon Treaty by the people of Ireland .
Member of the Commission . - Madam President , I thank Mrs Ţicău for her very positive evaluation of the approach to the blacklist .
The current crisis is having serious repercussions for the labour market , threatening the recent progress made in relation to female employment , given that women are less likely to be able to find a new job and that they are more disadvantaged to begin with .
We cannot make these mistakes with people &apos;s money .
The principles of the rule of law must be respected .
For this reason , it is inconsistent that a student who has obtained a visa to take a course in Portugal should not have the option to go , for example , to Belgium to gather information from a specialised library for the writing of his thesis .
Given that this involves a specific budgetary instrument , and that the amount requested is legally acceptable and complies with the provisions of the interinstitutional agreement of 17 May 2006 between the European Parliament , the Council and the European Commission , namely point 28 , I am voting in favour of this proposal , and hope that it contributes to reducing the economic difficulties of this region &apos;s inhabitants , and to relaunching the local economy .
Vice-President of the Commission . - You will be clearly informed about the full procedure and it can be scrutinised .
In consequence , we voted against .
My fourth point is that my home region - I come from eastern Germany - is an area where this policy has advanced economic development .
In the area of workforce planning the Committee on Budgets is bearing in mind proposals and changes to the structure of services and the workforce plan submitted by the Presidency .
A further key issue is the funding of innovation in the SME sector , upon which we should place much more emphasis .
( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , economic policy coordination , growth , employment , innovation , social inclusion : those are the slogans of the new 2020 strategy , that is , the one which , after the Lisbon Strategy , is supposed to guide Europe towards the end of the crisis that is weakening Europeans &apos; spending power and spirits .
The agreement negotiated includes the most ambitious disciplines for non-tariff barriers ever negotiated with a third country .
( GA ) I commend Mr Schwab for bringing the work to completion .
There is a clear attempt to sideline Parliament on this important issue and Parliament &apos;s Legal Service has confirmed that a different legal basis which would have allowed full involvement of Parliament in the process could have been chosen for this proposal .
Given recent market developments , interest and expenditure projections also seem to be on the low side .
For us , the question arises as to what strategy we can use in response to this .
( SL ) Mr President , Commissioner , today we are deciding the course of energy development up to the year 2020 , but this period is much too short .

The events of the past 10 days have shown that the situation is far from being resolved at this stage .
This , then , is not the moment for us to start to keep our mouths shut .
Therefore , I welcome the outcome of this vote .
It should be said that the Gebhardt report voted on today is less concerned with the content of the text than with assessing the Member States &apos; efforts to transpose it .
The fact that more and more European countries have sought the mobilisation of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund ( EGF ) makes it clear that the effects of this phenomenon have been felt by all sides , justifying in itself the name which has been given to the fund .
That is , too few barriers against products from emerging countries such as China , with its low wage rates , grossly undervalued currency and its artificially impoverished home market .
When these requirements are met and guaranteed , health risks decrease and population growth takes place under controlled conditions which offer security .

A concluding remark on Croatia .
That is what I can tell you .
This , however , is a victory for democracy in Africa and sends an important message to many countries undergoing political elections in this continent .
I am encouraged by the results of the informal European Council .
However , adequate statistics are required to do this , compiled using common collection methods , aimed at developing programmes targeted at these groups of tourists in every EU Member State .
In view of this , it is important that the regions that are already out of Objective 1 be able to go through an intermediate phase that consolidates the development of which they have already shown themselves to be capable , instead of being abruptly abandoned , thus jeopardising the progress made in the meantime .
The question is what the purpose of these permanent structures is .
Women are , of course , particularly vulnerable if they have suffered violence in their home - rape or sexual abuse , stalking or other kinds of gender-based violence .
I should say that this is not a new debate , nor is it the first time we have debated it in this House .
A conservative estimate by Europol suggests that half a million women will be bought and sold in Europe in 2009 .
The additional EUR 176 million will not just be given to the poorest countries , but also to emergent countries whose exports are already and increasingly destroying our manufacturing bases and the jobs of our taxpayers .
I advise Members who read their speeches to give them to the interpreters in advance , as this helps to improve the quality of the interpreting .
I can tell Mrs Lunacek that I myself signed an agreement with the Georgians where they absolutely commit themselves to not using one cent of the European Union money .
In this way , we would achieve equal contributions from each Member State , without unnecessary complications .
The next thing I would like to mention is that we will start all but one initiative - the Smart Cities , which came later , on your initiative , and which talks predominantly about resource efficiency - during 2010 , but do not think that the things we are talking about here are not ongoing already : they are , especially in research .
By assaying the members and observers of the SCO , we can safely conclude that these countries own a significant proportion of the world &apos;s oil and gas reserves .
India &apos;s efforts in building a strong economy must be backed up by the political will to improve the situation in terms of human , social and environmental rights .

I am pleased to say that , as a Portuguese and a Member of the European Parliament , I voted in favour of the re-election of José Manuel Durão Barroso as President of the European Commission .
The credibility of the European Union is at stake .
I believe that what is at stake here , and what has been at stake in many discussions that we have had on immigration in the European Parliament , is that we have a repressive policy on immigration that has been almost entirely completed , with nothing missing : the primary function of the European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders of the Member States of the European Union ( Frontex ) , that of the Schengen Agreement , and even that of the liaison officers - which is currently being amended , as it has been before - is to control borders , which is a repressive function .
Now you have sent in the IMF as the shock troops for neoliberal capitalism to make the Irish people pay .
Madam President , it is regrettable that the Swedish Presidency could not be represented here tonight in the person of a Minister , as it would very much have liked .
Whilst we have a central monetary policy , there is local responsibility for budgetary and finance policies .
That is also an art , by the way , that is being exploited in Iraq and in Afghanistan , and one in which the United States has also found some support amongst a few Member States of this Union .

The issue of foodstuffs has also been widely debated .
In addition to the American and Canadian military , I must also applaud the rapid and efficient deployment of groups from Slovakia and the international Military Order of Malta .
If they bothered to turn up at the committees to which they are entitled to turn up , they would know that we are not voting on this today but we are going to vote on this in January .
It is simply not acceptable to treat our constituents like mushrooms , to keep them in the dark and cover them with fertiliser .
I was therefore very pleased to support this report .
The resolution draws attention to the urgent need for more operational financial instruments with which we can support economic development , the modernisation of infrastructure and investment in areas , where they are effective ... where the effects may be somewhat less visible , but which will be felt in the long term , for example , in education , integration of research and academic institutions and the introduction of new technologies .
Secondly , rescuing Opel is in the common interests of Europe as a whole .
Without effective border controls , the European agriculture sector will have a very difficult future .
