We must work for the people of Haiti and we must help the people of Haiti .
Constructing the EU budget during a financial crisis , with a very narrow budget margin and new areas of work relating to the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon , is not easy .
As the Commission wants to encourage new Member States , it should consider eliminating this obvious inconsistency .
I think that an in-depth political dialogue needs to be established on combating terrorism and money laundering , on the financing of terrorism and organised crime , and on combating the manufacture of , trade in and accumulation of weapons .
We should note that Iceland - precisely because it has reservations concerning CFP - does not want to join the European Union .
The low pay sector in Europe must be reduced in size rather than continually being fostered .
All over the world , too , non-religious men and women are being killed or imprisoned because they do not respect the rites , dogmas or religious practices from which they have freed themselves .
If it is adopted by Parliament and the Council , this directive will confirm that the European Union values the important contribution third-country workers make to our economies and our societies .
When we discussed the murder of Governor Salman Taseer , I warned about the rise of religious extremism in Pakistan .
Nine states have still not reached this target today ; I am sure you would agree with me that if we want to be successful , we need this target to have the same degree of adherence as the previous ones .
I believe that the legislation is particularly important for the countries which acceded most recently as they still lag behind in the area of separate waste collection .
What we notice is that we are demanding more and more of our farmers .
Instead , we are making a humanitarian crisis out of the fact that one of the greatest world powers , Italy , is having to tackle the problem of taking in 5 000 people .
Regarding the aviation industry , we have already said that we are looking at what we can do , also based on the precedent that was already there after 11 September .
As Altiero Spinelli said , &apos; creating Europe depends on you as well &apos; , and this is now a real possibility .
In this context , I would like to welcome the vision of the common agricultural policy outlined in the report .
This is changing , however , and it is a huge step forward in the direction of a European democracy .
In the past , we have adopted several resolutions on that problem , including protection of minorities and anti-discrimination policies .
Of course , that will be limited to the resources that the Council and Parliament make available to this policy .
I confidently voted for it and hope that it will send a clear message to the Council , which will take into account the European Parliament &apos;s position .
Now that the Commission has finally tabled the proposal , which Parliament has called on it to do for so long , all of a sudden , the sceptics and nay-sayers express concerns .
Although President Kibaki has ordered these provisions to be amended a week later , we are not aware as to what these &apos; amendments &apos; envisage .
Madam President , I voted in favour .
President of the Commission . - Mr President , I do not yet have a draft legislative proposal in my pocket .
Madam President , this has been a complicated issue to deal with .
Small businesses need to have administrative simplification now .
I strongly believe that what is important is to protect our citizens &apos; rights and not just to tick boxes .
We do not propose VAT exemption in the legislation .
Hence the report that we are presenting is the result of a highly coordinated effort .
Therefore , it is necessary to develop a new approach to economic governance , to create a true economic union , to improve coordination and to harmonise financial and even fiscal policy .
Thus , next May , during the European Maritime Day celebrations in Rome , stakeholders will examine the links between maritime heritage and sustainable regional tourism , amongst others .
Following the Green Paper consultation , the Commission will bring forward its legislative proposals for the common strategic framework by the end of this year .
However , in order to ensure that this new course is productive and sparks a transition towards a safe , prosperous , stable and therefore self-sufficient Afghanistan , it is very clear that the military dimension of the intervention by the international community must be accompanied by growing commitment on the civil and political front .
The crisis in the livestock sector is not only the result of rising production costs .
The third is that the standard-setting process must also be transparent in a way that ensures that stakeholders are able to inform themselves of upcoming , ongoing and finalised work .
The priority now is to rebuild infrastructure , ensure that the situation returns to normal and , above all , rebuild Madeira &apos;s image abroad and regain people &apos;s trust in its tourism industry , thereby stimulating its economy and development .
( SV ) Madam President , the important question now is how can we avoid new scandals and new risk situations .
Kenya is currently a democracy and I firmly believe that no one , President Kibaki included , wants to return to those times .
Cohesion policy needs to be an effective tool for responding to the socio-economic challenges brought about by the financial crisis and for reducing disparities between the levels of development of European regions .
Neither is it the case that the Presidency wishes to unnecessarily restrict insight or debate in any respect .
( NL ) Madam President , as a Dutch MEP , I followed this legislation with due attention and care .
I would now like to turn to the new partnership for modernising universities .
in writing . - ( PT ) I voted in favour of Parliament &apos;s resolution as I agree that the transparency of the information provided by the issuer of a financial instrument rated by a designated credit rating agency may potentially represent substantial added value for the functioning of the market and the protection of investors .
It could decimate our economy ; make us uncompetitive while the developing world gallops ahead .
Only solidarity can curb the speculative activities of which Greece is a victim today and which may hit other countries in the euro area at any moment .
Too many women have to put up with wage disparities , are marginalised when it comes to employment , have no job security and , for this , training is the only way of bringing them back into society and out of poverty .
in writing . - ( ES ) In view of the fact that some of the expressions included in paragraph 34 , introduced by the opinion of the Committee on Development , are so ambiguous that they could be interpreted as being somewhat complacent regarding something as repulsive as abortion , the Spanish delegation of the Group of the European People &apos;s Party ( Christian Democrats ) has asked the group for a separate vote on that paragraph , in order to make it crystal clear that it is opposed to any initiative aimed at infringing the inalienable rights of the most vulnerable .
For this to happen , we need to propose a competent person for this position who will be able to maintain calm on the markets , in the media and in general public opinion in what is , today , a very difficult situation .
It cannot engage , as has already happened in this Chamber , in crude , theatrical performances in the argument over what the Italian Government or other governments are doing .
The EU must adopt a clear position with regard to an organisation which can play an important role in regional security and in promoting democratic values and human rights .
The problem is not only how the European Arrest Warrant is carried out , but also that prison conditions in various countries in Europe are such that you really cannot carry on sending people there any more .
I therefore want to congratulate the Council , the Commission and the High Representative on the action that they have taken .
However , the British enjoy perfectly good human rights under our own law and we do not need the protection of the European Union .
They deserve a clear and plain answer .
The errors are occurring in public procurement and in the payment of cohesion funding , despite the existing control systems , which have been approved by the Commission .
This aspect is also supported as part of the Stockholm Programme .
This is the only way we will be able to achieve sustainable growth in Europe and resist the ever-growing pressure of globalisation .
In particular , this strategy should guarantee conditions that place small and medium-sized enterprises on an equal footing with their competitors outside the EU by adopting safeguard clauses and strong , effective measures to combat the extremely serious problem of counterfeiting , including through effective trade defence instruments .
So no , 2010 was a very hot year , climate change is real and the measures we are taking are good for the economy .
It has proved effective in speeding up the transfer between EU countries of people suspected of committing serious crimes , including terrorism and organised crime .
And black clouds in the area of human rights are actually coming to Moscow once more , because - as you heard yesterday - the constitutional court has discussed the possible reinstatement of the death penalty from next year , and for liberals this is definitely a very tough subject .
You cannot do too much on energy with EUR 200 million .
However , it is also extremely important to increase the trust of society in this branch of medicine , especially because every so often , news comes to the attention of public opinion in Europe about a variety of irregularities , including the illegal trafficking of organs from unknown sources .
It is only Belarus that participates to a limited degree in the cooperation with the EU , and its further participation in the ENP should be conditional on its willingness to respect the fundamental principles of democracy and freedom .
( PT ) Madam President , I would like to begin by pointing out the importance of relations between the United States and the European Union , particularly during a time of global economic crisis .
In the light of the information we have now , a 30 % reduction target will cost less than what was estimated to be the cost of cutting emissions by 20 % two years ago .
These two developments are worrying enough on their own , but together they are a cause for more serious concern .
All of this must be done , Mr President , whilst bearing in mind that often it is more difficult to maintain the balance of freedom than to shake off the yoke of tyranny .
Nevertheless , we still have some concerns regarding the stronger role for the Commission in evaluating national plans and inspection reports , as well as the adaptations to the Treaty of Lisbon , which focus more power on the Commission through the so-called &apos; delegated acts &apos; .
Therefore , the Council remains determined that the perpetrators of crimes in Srebrenica and in Bosnia and Herzegovina in general , as well as elsewhere in the region of the Western Balkans , must be brought to justice .
The European Union has played an active and decisive role in encouraging the G20 in this respect .
Based on the precedent of bird flu , resulting from the H5N1 virus , the EU has been able to introduce , along with international organisations such as the World Health Organisation , the World Bank and others , effective procedures for exchanging information and coordinating technical assistance , as well as financial instruments such as a trust fund at the World Bank .
( The speaker stops )
We are still living in very difficult conditions .
It would be very difficult to interrupt Europol &apos;s work .
I am thinking in particular of what we can do to achieve a more sustainable transport system .
Since social conditions in the various Member States are deteriorating , it is unacceptable for funds to be channelled away from the employment and social inclusion area towards other priorities that have been defined in the meantime , even if it is to the area of microfinance .
What is more , the freedom of the press in Turkey is under severe pressure .
Many of you have spoken about Russia .
With the looming economic crisis , the Roma may be able to help solve some of Europe &apos;s deepest problems .
Mr President , Baroness Ashton , thank you for your clear statement .
The first and absolutely most important thing that must be considered of course is human health , so we have to be sure that this is protected by all means .
Mr Barroso said that this is only right as otherwise , if the Commission were to accept legislative proposals from Parliament through written declarations and resolutions , it would violate the treaties , which do not permit this .
I welcome the swift action taken by the European Commission and the proposed legislative changes .
The ceiling was raised from EUR 12 billion to EUR 25 billion , but a substantial part of this amount has already been earmarked .
The problem is with the legal basis and not the content .
On these issues , there has been no rapprochement .
I know that John would wish this agreement to be translated into action sooner rather than later , and so , indeed , would many patients across the EU who have already waited long enough .
Security and prevention measures on offshore oil platforms in the EU ( debate )
It is very important to establish a system for legal migration , taking account of the needs of Europe &apos;s labour market and the capacity of each Member State to receive and integrate immigrants .
Nevertheless , allowing the UN and other organisations to arrange safe passage from the conflict zone for these civilians is essential to avoid further bloodbaths .
There is also a need for confidence in our shared commitment to preserve our particular brand of social market economy , and in our long-term agenda for a low-carbon economy .
I obviously understand Parliament &apos;s concern to see the citizens &apos; initiative implemented as soon as possible and it is one that I share .
At the same time , I did not endorse the amendments proposed by some of our fellow Members , who wanted to identify Iran as an enemy of the West .
The Commission and the Member States must make the introduction of sustainable forest management mandatory within the European Union
Indeed , I approve of the report &apos;s aim , which is to set out pointers , ideas and practical proposals for consideration in due course with a view to formulating a common strategy for the recovery , conservation and improvement of agricultural soils .
Ten years ago , we were still largely immersed in our own concerns .
Only recently , I was on a visit to Pakistan , where I met the President , the Prime Minister and prominent ministers to discuss human rights and the fight against terrorism .
I would like to take the opportunity to express my concern regarding the decision of the town council in the Serbian town of Negotin to demolish the foundations of a Romanian-language Orthodox church , even though the priest , Boian Alexandru , had obtained the necessary approvals .
I would also like to say that in recent weeks , our strategic relationships with the United States and with the Russian Federation have taken great steps forward .
Now the Commission needs to act .
Member States have been changed beyond recognition by migration .
Their political will , in terms of whether or not they want an accession procedure , will be judged on this point and not on military-type missions , such as Afghanistan , which the report again considers to be an achievement of this country .
( IT ) Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , in the current difficult economic and financial scenario , Europe must continue to support projects in the sector of energy efficiency and renewable energy for a sustainable and social competitive economy .
It is not long since I reminded Parliament that elections are not free in Belarus , that freedom of expression , association and protest do not exist and that there have been an increasing number of repressive activities directed by the authorities .
My second point is that Parliament has adopted a clear position for the Copenhagen Summit .
I understood that the word mentioned most was sustainability , so sustainability is a general agreement , a framework for general agreement .
It is not practical to start a debate , today , in the very few hours that remain , on a subject that will only be concluded in 2012 or 2013 .
The question of young people acquires even greater significance in the context of the current situation - the economic crisis and demographic factors in Europe .
I am pleased that the European Parliament has today adopted the necessary sanctions against the Russian officers involved in the trial and the death of Magnitsky .
Over time , the ability of people to move freely within the EU has become not only a basic component of the internal market but a fundamental right .
Just as it was two years ago in Copenhagen , when the climate change conference was there , it was the coldest at the climate change conference in Cancún that it had been for decades .
We agree that research is not a synonym for innovation ; innovation stands on its own , though it might derive from research .
I firmly believe there is a need to try and prevent the negative consequences of becoming dependent on gambling .
The Haitian people , sorely tried by history and nature , must receive from the international community the necessary instruments to learn to help themselves .
Mr President , although it is late , we are discussing a subject which , as was said a few moments ago , is extremely important .
Ladies and gentlemen , I believe that today we all have reason to be satisfied , for , with the adoption of this legislation and the approval of the third maritime package at the beginning of March , the European Union has strengthened its position as a leader in maritime safety .
What we need instead is a smart balance between responsible fiscal policy on the one hand and continued labour market support on the other .
If we were to allow this in Europe , then it would only take a few years before all our ships flagged out to countries such as Hong Kong or Singapore .
What we are talking about here was a deliberate admixing and we are being made into repositories for this poison , one which does not break down by itself and which therefore continues through generations of people .
Eighty-eight percent of the population are in need of food aid , there is a lack of essential medical supplies in the hospitals , and thousands of tons of aid cannot be brought into Gaza because not enough trucks are being allowed in .
Journalists and NGO workers in Russia risk their lives every day in the course of their work .
The new US President , Barack Obama , has stated that he wants nuclear disarmament .
The old buildings are extremely poorly insulated and a large number of residents are unable to pay to have their homes insulated out of their own pocket .
We must also try and ensure that the quality of criminal justice legislation is better in the future .
Perhaps one reason why - to answer Jo Leinen &apos;s point - is that in some countries , like Portugal , ferrets are still classified as vermin so pet owners are reluctant to take their animals to those countries .
Consequently , I and a number of my colleagues have re-tabled an amendment that has already been voted for once by this Parliament .
A lot of people criticise the common agricultural policy , because they believe that it has caused environmental damage and has in the past and even today continues to put developing countries at risk on numerous counts , especially in terms of agriculture and development .
We do not believe that the proposal to include bluefin tuna ( Thunnus thynnus ) in Appendix I of the CITES is justified , in the light of the available data .
Nonetheless , the European Arrest Warrant must be amended today , as its application is obviously incompatible with the standards we have called for , particularly in terms of the checking of proportionality in individual cases .
This equivalence can be amply justified and coordination between legal systems can be seen as a matter of justice , not least where social benefits are concerned .
It is not necessary to buy CDs from Switzerland ; there is another way to go about this .
However , the nuclear power plant alerts in Fukushima have provoked an emotional debate over the use of nuclear energy in the European Union in general .
I already urge future managers of this European office not to ignore cooperation with the European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders , with the European migration network and with the competent bodies in Member States and third countries involved in migration and asylum activities .
It is a comprehensive package as only comprehensive solutions can have any result in the multiplicity of problems that have accumulated in Africa .
The Commission &apos;s proposal seeks to ensure equal treatment for self-employed men and women .
That is why we have not voted in favour .
The Commission is still working with the same composition as before , but I would like to stress very strongly here : we do have a European Commission , it still is not the new Commission , but work on this is going on all the time .
This economic union means , most importantly , economic and social governance of the Union .
We reached broad agreement on the establishment of a European Systemic Risk Board .
The Presidency must interrupt negotiations until it can guarantee the rights of citizens and parliaments .
Childcare facilities - Barcelona objectives ( debate )
I should take this opportunity to remind you once again that SMEs are the most authentic representatives of the European economic fabric and provide numerous examples of excellence that should be encouraged and supported .
Madam President , for 12 years , I have been asking the Commission and the Council a question which has remained unanswered , as they claim it is hypothetical .
We are all concerned to provide young people with the best tools to help them find a job .
In addition , we want to create a cross-border , digital internal market and to establish a global perspective on the internal market .
I therefore agree with the rapporteur on the need to expand the range of products provided through this food aid programme and on the fact that the primary source of supply should be represented by reserves deriving from intervention in the agricultural markets , thus constituting an important aspect of the common agricultural policy .
Developing countries are the most vulnerable countries to climate change .
One is that the basic rights for people with disabilities include the right to information and the right to access .
A classic example of transferring the burden of proof is the so-called assumption of paternity and there are many more examples .
In the same way , Russia has conducted provocative military manoeuvres in the proximity of the Baltic States , which expressed their concern over the transaction to which I referred .
Secondly , I have personal doubts about the merits and benefits of changing the Late Payment Directive .
It is not about damaging South-South trade or damaging in any way , shape or form the opportunities and the sovereignty of those countries that wish to open up trade .
At present , the CAP supports sustainable soil management through direct payments subject to compliance with environmental requirements , especially good agri-environmental practices regarding soil erosion , soil organic matter and soil structure , as well as through specific rural development measures , especially payments for agri-environmental measures which go beyond the basic conditions set out under the Good Agricultural and Environmental Conditions .
This is not interference on our part in Chinese internal affairs , as Beijing maintains , but the appeal of men and women , of movements and parties that intend to build a world free of intolerance on every continent .
I think that the proposals tabled by the European Commission will , in terms of strengthening relations between both continents , facilitate the adoption of a specific action plan during the Summit .
Yes , Mr Gahler , I would like very much to do as you wish , and I have in fact done that in the past .
And just imagine if Turkey joins the European Union and uses such common legal procedures as the European Arrest Warrant .
If they start doing that , they will get into conflict with the parties on whose ballots we were all elected , and with the voters represented by these parties .
However , for this to actually enter into force - and some people have already said this - we need the support of all of the European Heads of State or Government in order to persuade President Klaus , too , to sign the treaty .
I therefore call on the Commission to do everything in its power to solve the disputes as quickly as possible and to take into account the courses of action proposed in this report .
I agree that setting up the points of single contact is an essential part of effective implementation of this directive .
Moreover , when Mrs Kratsa went to Marseille , we gave her a lot of support on this issue .
I would like to say a few words about the context of this discharge .
The proposal which suggests that thrombin from cattle and / or swine should be included on the list of food additives approved in the EU does not give us any guarantee that this substance has a clear benefit for consumers , and ultimately this may mislead consumers .
However , in the decision that we mention in this oral question , the Commission does give a definition of social housing .
in writing . - ( IT ) Madam President , I voted in favour of the report .
In my judgement , the Union will therefore need to pursue a number of things in its policy : sustainable employment , a good working environment , safe work , no brain drain , and decent work .
If you have read the report thoroughly you will also have been able to observe the facts : namely that the Netherlands - I cannot speak for the United Kingdom but I am speaking now on behalf of the Netherlands - is one of those countries with the lowest percentage of fraud , while it is also stressed that , where fraud occurs , it is to be tackled very hard .
We base our findings on the evidence and it is what we report to this institution , which we have the obligation to assist in this discharge procedure .
So I am happy .
This is an issue we must address , and we must cultivate in Europe the risk-taking spirit that exists in the USA among the young generation of Americans .
The next item is the report by Mrs Andrikienė , on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs , on the Annual Report on Human Rights in the World 2009 and the European Union &apos;s policy on the matter .
Mr President , Commissioners , ladies and gentlemen , one of the strong ideas of this report is the need to establish a vital link between the common commercial policy and the common fisheries policy .
All of these elements will undoubtedly lead to decent working conditions for fishermen while reducing injuries and deaths .
Tourism accounts for 4 % of GDP in the EU , 2 million undertakings are involved in it , and it pays for approximately 8 million jobs .
Many cities have been wondering for years why their expectations concerning tourism remained unfulfilled after they were chosen to be the European Capital of Culture .
This regulation is very important because it aims to ensure that the Commission is accurately and regularly informed of investment projects in energy infrastructure , at both national and cross-border level , so that the Union can ensure that the internal market functions correctly and that all the Member States have a secure energy supply .
The other bands should be released by 1 January 2012 , as stipulated in the Commission proposal .
The construction of landfills complying with the standards of the EU Landfill Directive is already progress compared to the practice of illegal dumping of waste .
Until we create wealth in Africa which can be retained and is not brought back , we will not succeed .
I shall now move on to the European Union Crime Prevention Network .
I voted for this nomination for the President of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , given the candidate &apos;s skills and the extensive experience that he has gained over the years .
I consider it to be extremely important for us to ensure that we do not fail in our attempts to give the field of energy a higher priority in the 2012 budget .
in writing . - According to the report voted today , the EP :
14 / 2 : I voted in favour of this as it will reduce the negative impact of EU legislation on cargoes of non-GM soya beans destined for the UK .
( For the outcome and other details of the vote : see Minutes )
We probably relied too much at the beginning on Member States sharing our concern about the negative public and political impact of the negative DAS when , in fact , our call for action only really became effective when backed up by the policy of &apos; warn , solve or suspend payments &apos; .
Food security is another priority in the new common agricultural policy .
On financial regulation , the European Union wants to move the frontier further : no financial product , no institution , no market , no jurisdiction should be exempt from regulation .
Mr Coelho and others have been making this concern known for some time and it is worth putting on record that , while these significant delays are obviously highly worrying on their own , the key issues here for Parliament , as you know , are those of transparency and accountability , particularly when we are dealing with sensitive data , and sensitive data in this area .
Of course , responsibility for labour market policies lies with Member States , but we can and should use existing European instruments to help Member States keep people in employment and train them for the jobs of the future .
Mr President , I read in the applicable financial regulation that the Secretary-General and High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy , assisted by the Deputy Secretary-General , shall have full responsibility for administering the appropriations entered in Section II - Council - of the budget and shall take all measures necessary to ensure that they are properly managed .
Mrs Hedegaard , the question is simple - is there a climate for such change in Europe ?
This is yet another reason for supporting greater research activity and ensuring a uniform European framework .
I would like to invite both parties to solve the name issue in an open and generous European style , as advocated yesterday by President Barroso .
What is clear is that the political will is not there .
My second point is that the report mentions CCS technology as having the potential to meet our environmental targets while exploiting a source of energy - coal - that is largely available in Europe .
When the London voters become aware of Baroness Ludford &apos;s position on these issues , hopefully they will grant her a one-way visa out of the European Parliament in the European elections on 4 June 2009 .
Mr President , we have only just learnt of the death of Umaru Yar &apos;Adua .
In accordance with Articles 101 ( 1 ) and ( 3 ) , 103 ( 1 ) and 105 ( 3 ) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union , forms of horizontal cooperation are allowed between companies , provided that these agreements contribute to improved production or distribution of products , or to promoting technological or economic progress , and that there are benefits for consumers .
in writing . - ( NL ) As the European Parliament , we have to make sure that the EU &apos;s accession to the European Convention on Human Rights ( ECHR ) does not reinforce the current trend of judges of the European Court of Justice and of the European Court of Human Rights overruling decisions taken democratically by Member States , in the areas of asylum and immigration , for example .
I welcome the fact that the Commission has proposed a regulation updating EU asylum law since , given current circumstances , this is urgently needed .
I am also a fighter for human rights .
So there is the future and there is the past .
We cannot ignore the progress that has been made .
I am voting against this text , which favours the possibility of an agreement between Europe and the United States on the transfer of SWIFT data .
Let me give a brief synopsis of what has happened since the early morning of 1 January 2009 - New Year &apos;s Day .
If only you could conquer your reflexive dislike for us , you might find that it would bolster your own democratic credentials .
You , too , may have seen recently posters displayed on the trains of the French national railway , SNCF , which were asking customers to report any acts committed by Romanians to the SNCF &apos;s national security agency .
Secondly , Parliament is aware that a new Euro-Mediterranean road map will be adopted in the near future , possibly along with a new mechanism to facilitate trade and investment in the region .
I think that the words of Dokru Choedaka , a campaigner for the Tibetan language , ring true for all of us when he says that schools and language are the fabric of national identity .
Then we shall have made our contribution to overcoming the crisis .
The Republic of Croatia will be able to receive information on best practices to understand the nature of its drug problems and respond to them better .
I believe that the Commission could present either a proposal , for example , in the framework of consumer protection - consumer in this instance meaning citizen - or an initiative , which could also come from Parliament .
I do think this will happen earlier this year , but I would not want to allow a situation in which we receive a document , not for the year 2008 , but for 2007 .
Yes , I totally agree : let us set challenging targets , but let us not confuse targets with compliance .
This really ought to be self-evident .
That is the pride which I have and will continue to have in the years to come .
The vote will take place on 6 April at 12 : 00 .
Above all , we would have liked to have seen Parliament &apos;s resources being increased by means of redistributions and measures to increase efficiency , rather than the total budget being increased .
on behalf of the S &amp; D Group . - ( SV ) Madam President , one of the world &apos;s most developed countries from an economic and technical perspective has been thrown into a state of humanitarian crisis .
in writing . - ( FR ) While I recognise that the different agricultural sectors are worried about their future , I voted in favour of the report by Mr Dess as it advocates a strong and sustainable common agricultural policy ( CAP ) benefiting all farmers .
I hope that the commissioner will confirm this fact .
It has been very clear from the beginning , in my contact with the different rapporteurs on the whole package , that there would have to be some amendments .
I call on the Commission to exert pressure to counter possible opposition on all these points ; I am sure it can count on the support of Parliament in this .
The European Commission figures on this issue are , moreover , very worrying .
For this reason , greater legislative transparency is needed , particularly on copyright and consumer protection law and fiscal and labour law .
We must develop as well , and body scanners are only one element in this variety .
Extremism is still a current threat and these extremists have an unwitting friend in the ballot box - lethargy .
That cannot be right .
At least 346 of the country &apos;s citizens , including minors , were either hanged or stoned to death in 2008 .
That is why we will have to ensure the availability of certified and registered websites offering considerable amounts of independent , objective and non-promotional information .
Good : we are bringing those prices down so that text messaging will become a normal thing if you are at home or if you are in a neighbouring country .
The Presidency-in-office of the Council and the Commissioner , Mrs Malmström , have both stated that these two countries comply with the technical and legal requirements , and I add my voice to theirs .
First , the role of legislators in , and the institutional set-up of , EU-US relations is very important .
- ( FR ) Madam President , the report &apos;s proposals are along the right lines , and I should like to commend the rapporteurs on them .
We note clear differences , and comparing the text to the Charter of Fundamental Rights , the text shows inconsistencies and differences in values and principles .
I also believe that democratic institutions will manage to strengthen negotiations with Greece concerning amicable solutions to problem areas .
The European Union must initiate this change and set an example to its trade partners .
The detention of Muhannad Al Hassani as a leading human rights defender is alarming .
Secondly , they take no account of the fact that EU legislation , when we get it right , cuts costs to businesses and cuts red tape by having a single set of standards - common rules for the common market - instead of 27 divergent and separate ones .
I am speaking to you , Commissioner , as someone who , being Portuguese , knows very well the difficulties involved in seeing the public debt grow , the deficit becoming difficult to control or public spending being excessively high .
That is why the proposal merges seven current legislative acts into one directive .
These should be the subjects of our debates if we are finally to end the agricultural crisis .
New instruments are required to tackle the demographic problems in rural areas .
Clearly there is unused potential in relations between the two , but there are more words than deeds and we need more deeds than words .
We must respond now , together .
The problem is not tariffs but the numerous restrictive regulations and obstructions faced by EU companies in gaining access to the Japanese market .
If I want to recycle cardboard , paper , plastics or glass , these are collected at the kerbside , from my home .
Finally , albeit late in the day , we have realised that we are all in the same boat and there is no point dealing with individual situations , especially in an improvised way .
It would not be appropriate for me to do so .
Will it understand that European responses to European challenges - the euro , energy , research and innovation and employment - are being sought in good faith ?
Establishing the structure of a funding system for developing countries , particularly the least developed , is of paramount importance , along with defining the sources and amounts of this funding , so as to ensure an agreement in Copenhagen .
Thankfully , through the good work that Albert Dess and all the other shadow rapporteurs have put in over the last months of negotiations , we now have a report that has some real substance and one that has many areas that we can support .
It is important for those who attempt to enter the European area at any price - sometimes paying with their own lives - to understand that there is only one possible route : legal immigration , with all its inherent rights and opportunities .
I think this and other measures will ensure that genuine citizens &apos; concerns can be brought forward while hopefully stopping those of vested interests .
Recent years have indeed seen too many attempts , in the name of political correctness , to subject even the Internet to censorship , so that controversial ideas are excluded from not only the printed press but also the World Wide Web .
This sector employs 12 million EU citizens directly , with another 26 million workers dependent on it .
I can only recommend you to follow the same principle in respect of the Hungarian media law , which has been in force for weeks now .
Europe cannot demand extremely damaging - but understandable - measures to control public audits and to fight the deficit , and , at the same time , take decisions that hurt the productive heartlands and capacities for wealth and job creation of those very same countries .
We call for the establishment of equitable relations and mutual respect between the two parties , based on the interests of their people and respect for the principles of non-intervention , disarmament and détente .
Of course , Britain can manage in the short run outside the euro , but over time , we stand to lose out : our businesses are handicapped in the European market by conversion costs and hedging costs that their competitors in that market do not face ; and inward investors into the European market will prefer to be in the major currency area rather than the smaller one .
With such a tax , we would have a practical , useful and fair instrument .
( ES ) Mr President , Commissioner Dimas , this is the first time I have been an MEP - I was elected on 7 June - but from the debate , it is clear that this matter comes back every September after the wave of devastating fires that particularly affect southern Europe : Italy , France , Greece and Spain .
Otherwise , it will be necessary to take radical action and introduce a visa requirement for American citizens .
The EU has to take a leading role in this process and help to find solutions that avoid exacerbating the conflict that is currently occurring in this country .
I therefore feel very frustrated that the creation of such a key instrument for the development of innovation in the EU is being held up by some countries over secondary issues such as the protection of language .
We are prepared to grant discharge , but now we really must go a step further .
If you wave at them , they only see one thing : the thing that they have real experience of , the Hitler salute .
What we do need are economic policies that respect the rights of our Member States , stimulate the sharing of best practice and focus on delivering EU added value ; policies which defend the benefits of the internal market and extend them further ; policies which provide a climate in which entrepreneurs and businesses can thrive in order to create jobs , raise our standard of living and contribute to a stronger society .
As far as the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is concerned , it is unfortunate and demoralising for Macedonia that accession talks have not yet started in Skopje , despite the fact that it is three years since Macedonia obtained candidate country status .
They are led by Mr Mario Zubović , who has just concluded the tenth meeting of the EU-Croatia Joint Parliamentary Committee .
At the same time , there are worries .
That is the point that I am making , and , in the case of Baroness Ashton , she has never been elected to public office in her entire life .
The EU is , in fact , the only trading block that does not provide direct funding to its GNSS programme .
The next item is the report by Marie Panayotopoulos-Cassiotou , on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs , on the organisation of the working time of persons performing mobile road transport activities - C6-0354 / 2008 -
On the other hand , I welcome the way that the issue of diversity in European agriculture is being addressed : competitiveness and innovation can , and should , go hand in hand with traditional agriculture , small-scale farming , organic farming and local distribution .
It is absurd to first applaud regime change in Tunisia and Egypt and to then immediately accept migrants en masse , or , more precisely , so-called refugees , from those countries .
Therefore , as long as things are controlled by officials who only look at sheets of paper and are not interested in anything else , all that we will be left with are just promises and no action .
( LT ) I would like to draw attention to some circumstances which seem important to me in resolving the matter of retaining and creating new jobs .
Three months have already passed since the tragic earthquake , and it would appear we are still unable to work out a common position on support for Haiti .
This must also unconditionally apply to tyre safety .
This is what we are trying to do .
The next item is the debate on the statement of the Council and the Commission : EU 2020 - Follow-up of the informal European Council of 11 February 2010
There is the coordination problem in Germany - various German MEPs have also said this , both from the governing bloc and from the opposition - with the two federal ministries , the sixteen Länder and the lack of coordination .
Nurses or toolmakers , for example , must , in future , have better opportunities on our labour markets and , above all , the internal market must function effectively as far as work is concerned .
The annual report on the protection of the European Union &apos;s financial interests is a bit like the Member States &apos; list of sins , which is why I would like to thank Mr Cătălin Sorin and the shadow rapporteurs from the other groups for their hard work .
The agreement provides a political , legal and economic framework for cooperation between the European Union and Serbia , and Serbia was unable to continue along the path of European integration without the ratification process getting under way .
I believe that throughout these events , which date back decades and are not just recent , the only losers have been ourselves in the western world , because we have never seriously tackled this problem and never sought to resolve it ; we continue to see it as a problem between two opposing parties .
Therefore , they must be given the opportunity to protect their own national economies more effectively against imported goods which are sold at dumping prices and which destroy local markets and local people &apos;s livelihoods .
That is a first step , but it does not go far enough .
We shall ensure that this change will take the direction of democracy and human rights because we see a change in the whole European neighbourhood .
in writing . - ( LT ) I voted in favour of this resolution because the EU and the African Union ( AU ) must jointly address key issues of common concern in order to successfully implement the partnership between Africa and the EU which is based on the mutual interest in exploiting their combined potentials .
An excessive , discriminative , and structurally distorting crisis tax .
That something is the will , free speech and the spirit of the Chinese people themselves .
EU taxpayers &apos; money must be used appropriately and effectively .
That clearly shows that we ourselves are not walking the walk when it comes to energy efficiency .
We must not forget that we need to fight for the ongoing and fundamental implementation of Parliament &apos;s parliamentary rights .
The common agricultural policy ( CAP ) should be reformed so that it can better respond to the challenges of food security , climate change , the sustainable management of natural resources , landscape management and maintaining a vibrant rural economy .
If they feel that the EU or government does not seem to be working for them , they always have the office of the Ombudsman to turn to , to seek redress .
I am aware of that and of the seriousness of the issue .
The Council always emphasises to the Commission and the partners that these agreements are a development instrument and that the advantages for development can be exploited to the full only through comprehensive regional agreements .
But for Russia , there are only pompous and hypocritical lectures .
We ensure free competition and cheap goods , and that is all very well and good .
Allow me to say a few words today about a colleague who , throughout his political career , has made a particular contribution to peace in the world and in the European Union .
We have supported our rapporteur at both first and second readings in committee , and I too am keen to congratulate and thank her .
Despite all the differences of opinion that we have , Mrs Győri , on this matter we will hopefully achieve a major success together .
There is an attempt here , however , to use the IPPC Directive as a back door through which to bring in parts of the soil protection directive , which we successfully fought off in the past .
I hope that the entry into force of the directive on combating late payment in commercial transactions will benefit most the European Union &apos;s small and medium-sized enterprises , which will therefore be afforded more protection and be provided with resources to increase investments and create new jobs .
The first budgetary point you raise relates to funding sources .
The Commission commits to clarifying the situation regarding Internet sales of cosmetic products prior to the date of application of the regulation .
Both countries have worked very hard and deserve the maximum amount of appreciation for their efforts .
Indeed , perhaps this day can serve to arouse awareness of these terrible crimes even in those who still do not believe that it happened , as even video recordings prove , and then the foundations for the necessary reconciliation can be laid .
- Mr President of the Czech Republic , I would like to offer you a warm welcome to the European Parliament .
Is the Commission receiving all the necessary information ?
It is , however , also true that democracy now needs innovation , reforms and changes to improve its quality , while maintaining the structures that have served us so far and the strength of their foundations .
This was not the time for us to give our support to this report .
In its action plan implementing the Stockholm Programme , the Commission stated that during the period 2011-2012 it will issue a communication on this violence and that the communication is to be followed up by an EU action plan .
What remains is the important homework that the service needs to do .
A reduction in resources means a reduction in political ambitions .
Generally speaking , I support you , but please do not demonstrate in the Chamber .
This is because , firstly , while in the crisis workers only lose their jobs , entrepreneurs who are in difficulty may lose their job , their workers and the whole business .
Finally , I would like simply to address those Members here who do not think that we should have an exception for doctors and the information that doctors are to provide .
( FR ) Mr President , as has already been highlighted , Tunisia is an important partner of the EU ; mention was also made of the extremely important role played by the social field in Tunisia .
I bring good cheer because one of the few successful outcomes of the Copenhagen conference was broad agreement on a mechanism that will enable developed countries to contribute financially to prevent the destruction of tropical rain forests .
However , such recognition means remunerating them for all the ways in which their creative contribution is used so that they can make a living from their profession and can be completely free to devote themselves to it .
The resolution will also allow Ukraine to take part in Union programmes and will define the implementation of new laws on gas now that Kiev has joined the Energy Community .
The European satellite navigation programmes , Galileo and the European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service ( EGNOS ) , will enable Europe to establish autonomy and strategic independence from other economic blocs , which is very important , and will contribute to improving the lives of the European public , as well as bringing direct and indirect benefits to the European economy .
( NL ) Mr President , the 2011 budget brings us face to face with the priorities of the European Union .
Mr President , over the last 10 months , the European Parliament has adopted a total of three resolutions on religious freedom in the Islamic Republic of Pakistan .
My feeling is that there is a lot of cooperation going on between the Member States on this .
I consider this a splendid opportunity for the European Parliament to urge - to require - that , in future , this budget be based on the European Union &apos;s own resources , as this Parliament will not be a real parliament until it also has complete control over its own resources , which it will be able to collect itself in future .
The ESF is not a crisis management tool per se , but now it has to function during a period of crisis .
It will apparently be the countries of Southern Europe , above all , that are hardest hit by climate change .
Nation states acting alone will be unable to give a sufficiently strong and coordinated response .
The European budget must be a budget which will support the Member States as they exit the crisis , and which is also able to respond to unexpected events more flexibly .
We believe that the European Union remains on the right track and we want to ensure by means of controls and transparency that we achieve the target of 20 % and that nothing goes wrong in Europe .
I am , of course , particularly pleased to be able to say that it was an initiative of the Group of the Greens / European Free Alliance that led to this groundbreaking event .
Over the coming weeks the Commission will table proposals on hedge funds , private equity and executive pay and , in time for the June European Council , the Commission will put forward a package for a new European supervisory system .
On behalf of taxpayers , we demand real added value for money spent at EU level .
However , cultivating a spirit of cooperation , political dialogue and joint efforts to meet specific targets will help enormously in building up trust , which is needed if viable solutions are to be achieved .
The dual European system could play a key role in promoting democracy and freedom of expression , and preserving and promoting media pluralism , as well as cultural and linguistic diversity .
- ( FR ) Mr President , it is difficult not to hide one &apos;s disappointment at the end of this summit .
They have managed to achieve an exceptional compromise with the Council , with the help , of course , of Vice-President Mr Barrot , whom I also congratulate .
( RO ) Madam President , the forthcoming EU-Africa Summit provides a good opportunity for devising a realistic cooperation strategy .
The report prepares us for the new powers we get on trade policy , where we now have full assent along with the Council on all trade matters , and our new powers in terms of agriculture and fishing , where we now have codecision .
We should also offer more help to women who have been abandoned by society .
We should stick to our decision , for it is written clearly in Amendment 464 that the payment is not increased .
In recent years , the countries of Eastern Europe have been told that they should privatise their banks , in other words , that they should subordinate them to Western European banks .
The best way to honour the victims of the atrocities of the war in the former Yugoslavia is to announce a day of commemoration so what happened can be remembered .
We have a newly elected government in the UK which has made promises in this area .
We have also managed to maintain some programmes supporting human rights and the proper administration of public affairs , for example a project to support children &apos;s rights in cooperation with UNICEF and projects in support of judicial reform .
GSP + is a valuable incentive system which offers developing countries further concessions if they sign and put into practice important international agreements on human rights , labour standards and protecting the environment .
Every Irish citizen and , indeed , every European citizen , has the right to travel to another European Union country to receive medical treatment .
The cornerstone of the EU exit strategy from the capitalist crisis is to impose sweeping changes in social security systems , to increase the retirement age and to drastically cut wages , pensions and social benefits .
I therefore support the adoption of this text and , at the same time , renew my support for the adoption of a specific financial instrument to protect the Union &apos;s forests .
In the case of the European Arrest Warrant ( EAW ) , we now know that this has problems and has caused doubts .
The constitution fails to provide an EU-conforming , modern , administrative structure .
There is something absurd about the fact that Euronews broadcasts in Arabic or Russian but not in Hungarian or in some other Member States &apos; languages .
I know that my country has administrative and democratic systems that are strong enough for it to fulfil its duties at the EU level unequivocally .
It is essential that our different countries be heavily involved in this project .
The economic crisis has changed the world irreversibly and there is clearly an increasingly urgent need for a new financial structure in the EU .
There must be an emphasis on providing European added value .
With regard to the Southern Neighbourhood , I shall make three points .
By restructuring our agricultural policy , we can make sure that the focus is on good animal welfare , that animals live in conditions suitable for their species , and that the animals are strong and robust , on the principle that prevention is better than cure .
I believe that as an MEP , it is worth mentioning , here and now , that one of the basic conditions for the free movement of people is to have a complete Schengen system operating efficiently and built on mutual trust .
However , we must give Turkey an opportunity to review its actions and hope that in the future , Turkey will be a democratic and free country .
As is the case for any prisoner , the State was responsible for his safety and for his life .
We therefore need a conclusion to the Doha Round now .
Notwithstanding those reservations , I support the report that has been submitted .
I would dearly like , Commissioner , to see the track-changes text in relation to proposals 29 and 30 ; it would be intriguing , I think , to see who is responsible for the changes and the very special language used there .
We are dismayed to note that , to date , the majority of the Member States have not satisfactorily delivered on their obligation and therefore , despite the traditional &apos; gentleman &apos;s agreement &apos; between Parliament and Council , we will not grant discharge until such time as the Member States fulfil their obligations under the Interinstitutional Agreement .
We now know that a person can be genetically disposed to developing cancer and that at least one enzyme is involved in triggering the disease .
However , we must again highlight the fact that the European Union is being forced to create new systems and values under unfavourable circumstances .
However , overall it remains a brutal one-party dictatorship .
I know that some Member States will be more sympathetic than others when it comes to giving financial aid to their airlines .
Therefore , I consider it to be extremely important that this financing instrument supports civil organisations , states and private individuals without the prior approval of the national governments being necessary .
We must therefore say a firm &apos; no &apos; to all attempts to adopt a universal and joint fisheries management model , and call for the due attention to be paid to the particular characteristics of the various European seas .
Even without this escalation of the conflict , in South Sudan , over 40 % of the population are already dependent on food aid .
I think Parliament was right after long negotiations to take the position that we would like to confirm and get clear commitments from both the Council and the Commission that Parliament &apos;s rights are met .
This issue must be addressed in the context of the reform of the common fisheries policy , and I know that Commissioner Damanaki will address this .
In Russia , freedom of the press and of the media is a really major problem .
The most important issue is drones .
The document rightly states that the growth of the trade deficit of the European Union and the United States has contributed to the international economic crisis to a large extent .
Unfortunately , we are also still not allowed to elect individual commissioners .
Such a plan is also in the interests of the Member States of the European Union .
The Treaty of Lisbon brought Parliament new responsibilities with respect to common foreign and security policy , and we are ready to take on these responsibilities , and to contribute to the choice of both policies and the individuals who will represent those policies throughout the world , by scrutinising those nominated for the European External Action Service , also including here the special representatives of the EU .
Protocols are the same as the Treaty and , of course , Ireland needs Europe ; Europe needs Ireland .
We are all well aware of the figures - thousands of people across Europe require organ transplants every year .
President-in-Office of the Council . - As the honourable Member has pointed out , improvement of road safety and reducing the high number of fatal accidents on Community roads are among the priorities of the Czech Presidency for the transport sector .
Dictators achieve this objective using the same methods : censorship , secret police , prison for those who think differently , breaking up and dividing opposition forces and complete control of the media .
I have two ad hoc proposals for Greece : the International Monetary Fund could extend the repayment period for the loan to Greece from three to five years .
All the same , we must help these countries in a different way , not by changing the conditions of the Stability and Growth Pact , but by offsetting the negative effect that they are suffering because they are outside the system .
Only today , Mr Brown and Mr Barroso reaffirmed their refusal to protect Europe , our industries and our jobs in the name of the all-important free market and globalisation .
Mr President , along with the approaching winter season , the threat of a new gas crisis is emerging from the east .
This year , only 11 % of the EUR 500 million available was requested .
Historians say the Roma came to Europe between the 5th and 9th centuries AD , and many European nations have been looking since then for a way to coexist with the Roma in the best way possible .
However , we need more and sustained assistance over time .
Once again the European Commission is selling short its farming and its farmers in order to obtain chance gains for service companies .
However , for the same reason , they are also potentially a massive distortion of trade , if their financing operations are not disciplined by common rules .
I thought they were subjects .
However , reviewing the rules regulating the funds themselves is equally important .
I do think , however - and let us be fair - that in what the Council representative said , there was one very important proposal .
By adopting this report , I welcome the fact that Amendment 74 was preserved , since it advocates the creation of a category of regions referred to as &apos; intermediate &apos; for the next programming period 2007-2013 of the cohesion policy and is therefore along the lines of fairer distribution of structural and cohesion funds between regions .
Instead , the production and consumption of local products must be emphasised , since transporting them results in lower greenhouse gas emissions .
I am sorry that , even after a presentation of 10 to 15 minutes , I failed to explain the rules we impose when we import from third countries .
Even if Pakistan was aware of the whereabouts of the al-Qaeda leader , who was the subject of an international arrest warrant , and therefore would have been called on to extradite him , it does not change the fact that the targeted killing was a violation of Pakistan &apos;s sovereignty .
With food security being a key factor in globalisation nowadays , we need to maintain our capacity for being self-sufficient .
Such noble intentions are only to be applauded .
We have to strictly adhere to these principles and , in this regard , keep a careful eye on our partners in Kosovo .
As the political parties are represented at European level , the institutions expect them to inform public opinion on European issues .
The Secretary-General relayed the responses of Israel , the Palestinian occupied territories and Switzerland , and in his observations , he said that the processes initiated by these three parties were under way and that no opinion could be given on the application of the Resolution by the parties concerned .
Mr President , Commissioner , the first question that must be answered is whether or not the issue of national minorities falls exclusively within national powers .
( EL ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , obviously the overwhelming majority in Parliament supports the uprising in Egypt and that is , of course , quite right , although there are a few exceptions , as we heard just now .
As we did a year ago , we are stressing that the global credit crisis is linked to the uncontrolled operation of the financial markets and we must be equally direct in stating today that the uncontrolled operation of speculative capital is a basic parameter of the current situation in the euro area and is to the detriment of European taxpayers &apos; money .
If you want to look at why we have had more layoffs than wage cuts in Ireland , that is the basis of it .
The issue on which there has been debate is its financing , as has also been mentioned here .
The new Commission , I presume , is pleased to be in place , but it is going to have to hit the ground running because of the problems we are discussing here .
This is because I believe that an agreement of this kind with Ghana could threaten cohesion and weaken the regional integration of ECOWAS , which we should be supporting , since it is most capable of producing positive effects for the local economy in the medium to long term , through its greater possibilities for participation by local bodies .
The same applies to the proposed Mercosur deal .
President Barroso , you said just now that Member States are achieving less than half what they set out to achieve on the 20 % target for energy saving by 2020 , so why is the Commission not pushing hard to make that target binding on Member States ?
My thanks to the Presidency for its clarity in this regard .
Let me touch briefly on most of them .
I also welcome the trade partnership agreements between the European Union and Central America and with the Andean Community , as well as the deepening of the existing Association Agreements with Mexico and Chile .
We need to introduce a labelling requirement for meat to enable its traceability .
It is important that we retain this determination and that , through coordination and implementation , Europe will be able not only to respond to the challenge internally but also to make an important contribution to the global response to this crisis of very great dimensions .
As you well know , under Community legislation , every request for asylum or residence must be examined in the Member State first entered by the applicant , regardless of his or her actual destination .
I would like to know how long the Commission will accept part of the EU &apos;s accession support to Turkey being used to reward the political allies of the governing party while ethnic and religious minorities are discriminated against , as a recent investigation has shown .
The Palestinian authorities have now instituted an independent investigative panel , which is very good news .
I think we should prepare for post-war order .
Money is tight and funds must get rapidly to the scientists in the lab , and not just to those who fill in the forms and check the accounts .
It called for a comprehensive strategy with a precise road map towards a common EU external policy on energy , recommending a number of actions to be taken : in the short term , solidarity mechanisms , unity in defending our interests , more efficient energy diplomacy ; and , in the medium term , diversification including Nabucco , storage , investments and interconnections .
Right now , as our discussion is taking place , in Minsk in the square opposite the Academy of Sciences , there is a demonstration initiated by the democratic opposition .
In order to achieve this objective , we must work together to develop international law and not simply interpret and implement it unilaterally .
&apos;Notes that some Member States have introduced the concept of a minimum wage ; suggests that other Member States might benefit from studying their experience ; calls on the Member States to safeguard the preconditions for social and economic participation for all and , in particular , to provide for regulations on such matters as minimum wages or other legal and generally binding arrangements or through collective agreements in accordance with national traditions that enable full--time workers to make a decent living from their earnings ; &apos; .
( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , when we reach the end of a budgetary procedure and it is possible to assess the work carried out as a whole , I think that we need to ask a very frank , straightforward question : is this a useful budget ?
We have repeatedly called on all parties to refrain from politicising the issue , and to act only with the best interests of the Roma families in mind .
For all these reasons , I voted in favour of this report .
That is what the electors think , and that is what many young people in Poland think , people with whom I have talked and who are interested , for example , in the Treaty of Lisbon .
The current generalised system of preferences ( GSP ) will soon be coming to an end .
The most important thing is that we try and ensure that the public and the consumer can be certain that the food they are buying in the supermarkets , in their local corner shops is safe to eat .
One key element of the citizens &apos; agenda is the Stockholm Programme for &apos; an open and secure Europe serving and protecting the citizens &apos; , which was adopted by the European Council during its meeting in December 2009 .
Slovenia does have high minority protection standards and we just wish that Slovenian minorities living in our neighbouring countries had similar rights .
Instead , I want to remind us of this tragedy and to express the wish that our common efforts can prevent genocides of this kind on the European continent in the future .
In response to these problems , the proposal for a directive provides for administrative procedures to be simplified as much as possible , for example , by limiting the obligation for prior authorisation of treatment by the national healthcare body , and by ensuring better exchange of information on medical services in other countries by setting up national contact points .
The role of the ITS in the area of road safety will also be discussed during the informal meeting of transport ministers to take place in late April in Litoměřice in my country .
The Union for Europe of the Nations Group has requested that a Commission statement on the earthquake in the Italian region of Abruzzo be inserted into the agenda .
Obviously , Commissioner , growth has not instilled a feeling of prosperity in the Albanian people .
Throughout the whole process , we have resisted heavy pressure from manufacturers to weaken the regulation and , in particular , to reduce the ambition of the long-term CO2 reduction targets .
This is my opinion on item 9 of this resolution .
However , if the coordination of budget policies means overriding national parliaments so as to put their citizens on a starvation diet , then I fear that that might be a fine EU idea which will itself end up starving to death .
I would remind Members of this House that these proposals build in safeguards to what is already a right for EU citizens under a European Court judgment a few years ago .
The Commission recently reinforced its commitment through the renewed social agenda and a report linked to the Communication on decent work of 2006 .
It shows that Europe is capable of assuming shared risk with Member States beyond the euro zone as well .
This shows that , in the face of the crisis , the European Parliament has been able to adopt political measures to benefit the citizens we represent through a synergy of wide-ranging political objectives .
We need to limit the administrative burden by simplifying the regulatory environment .
Recently , significant restrictions have been imposed on artistic groups which propagate Polish culture .
But in the European Union , we are doing everything we can to have a binding framework that commits ourselves and all the Member States to the principle of non-discrimination and to special protection for disabled people .
Of course , we also need to know how to offer leadership ability .
Adequate legal solutions are also required to ensure that religious pluralism is brought in line with European standards .
( PT ) Mr President , as the Franco-German directorate is no longer seated in this Chamber , I will direct my three questions on the recent frenzy of penalties to the Commission and Council .
Here , I would like to say a special thank you to my colleague , Mrs Jackson , for her Amendment 134 , which my group has decided to support .
These agreements have strengthened the dominant position of the US multinationals , which already control more than 80 % of the world market , and thus act against the interests , in particular , of the ACP countries , the outermost regions and Ecuador .
Furthermore , the introduction of this point c ) is not linked either to suggestions concerning from what date and how it will come into force , which we think will create additional problems for Member States .
This report sets out to open even wider the floodgates to legal and illegal immigration into the European Union , and fails to place the citizen &apos;s right to safety at the heart of its policy , but considers instead that it is the rights of criminals that should be recognised as so-called fundamental rights .
But it has been nine months since the economy started to recover from deep recession and it may take some time this year before the fragile pick-up in economic activity has an impact on reversing the trend in the labour market .
Thirdly , regarding the new top posts , we first of all need courage to advance and to support not portfolios but personalities , personalities that have long-term vision and commitment to the continuity of European values .
What we want to do here will help to protect that principle .
Mr President , I am just curious to hear this argument that somehow national parliamentary ratification is not legitimate because , if that is the case , let me just take the example of my own country , which has never , ever in the whole of its history , ratified an international treaty by means of a referendum .
These measures target the fight and resistance of the peoples , their vanguard , the communist movement , and the radical powers which refuse to bow down to the barbarism of the exploitative capital system .
( NL ) Mr President , surely it is common knowledge that the people from Libya who are arriving there are , for the most part , Islamic people , and that there are quite a few criminals , and even terrorists , amongst them ?
We need a more targeted approach to the choice of legislative instruments , which , in addition to the Institution , would give the President of the European Council the mandate to coordinate the relaunch of the single market , in close cooperation with the President of the Commission .
Nothing could be changed just by discussions in that group and we worked very much along these lines .
This will allow the SIS II project to continue in the light of technical requirements and a global schedule which are currently being redefined with the Member States &apos; experts .
At the same time , Turkmenistan is participating in the reconstruction of Afghanistan and provides logistics background for operations or activities of many EU Member States in the framework of the ISAF ( overflights ) as well as on a bilateral basis .
The action plan underlines this and builds on existing commitments made at the June EU-Pakistan Summit , including humanitarian aid , reconstruction support , assistance to the police and judiciary and strengthening democratic institutions and civil society to improve human rights , as well as agreements on trade and socio-economic development .
Moreover , I would also call on you to establish a kind of task force at Commission and Member State level to organise repatriation as effectively as possible .
Meat products can carry a particularly wide range of health risks if they are not produced in the appropriate conditions .
In the same connection , it is natural that the reform and harmonisation of product labelling should be assessed overall , as has now been agreed .
Therefore , I hope that already in this trialogue this strong sense of responsibility that we all share , and it could not have been otherwise , will open the way to calm , responsible and constructive negotiations for the future of our Union .
It is also - if you are looking at this as part of an overall policy - part of a sustainable return that people will actually go back with what they have earned .
Now that we are halfway through the Belgian Presidency , can the Council state what action it intends to take before the end of the Presidency with a view to implementing the measure called for by Parliament ?
I voted in favour of the EU resolution on Belarus as I feel that any move capable of introducing more democracy in any country in the world is a positive step .
This is a unique case in parliamentary history .
We consider that the US enforcement system is generally effective and efficient in the protection of certain intellectual property rights .
Another element concerns the acts of violence by the FARDC .
on behalf of the Verts / ALE Group . - Mr President , we are discussing the Latvian case precisely because it is unique .
We did not reach an agreement .
You are no doubt aware that a large majority of MEPs are ready to lend their backing to this route and I would like to urge you , with a quip , to leave the critics and the barking dogs to make their racket on the sidelines .
In the external field , I am very satisfied with the mid-term review of the EIB external mandate , supported by the Camdessus report , which concluded that the EU guarantee to the EIB is an efficient and forceful instrument with high financial and political leverage .
in writing . - UKIP believes that ongoing development and improvement in the present international network of facilities and agencies for organ exchange will not be facilitated by the EU &apos;s attempts to invade and regulate this network .
( IT ) Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , first of all I must thank the rapporteur Mr Fernandes for the estimated budget for Parliament , for having succeeded in balancing the requests from the Secretary-General and the suggestions of Commissioner Lewandowski with regard to the containment of the administrative expenditure of the European institutions .
In European society , the sustained trend towards the feminisation of poverty shows that the existing framework of social security systems and the various social , economic and employment policy measures adopted in the EU are not designed for the needs of women or for abolishing the existing disparities relating to women &apos;s employment .
The truth should therefore be told in its entirety : the truth about Italy &apos;s ability and willingness to welcome , protect and safeguard the rights of migrants who take part in and are victims of this trafficking is so glaringly obvious and well documented that it is not necessary for me to uphold it .
Furthermore , I believe that amendments that reduce the commitment to the three &apos; R &apos;s - replacement , reduction and refinement - needed to be supported .
The issue of the security of raw materials , too , will , in future , concern Europe more and more , for which reason we should be paving the way for the sustainable use of resources now , and pointing European policy in this direction .
This can only come about if , as highlighted in the report , &apos; the person is placed at the core of the policy action &apos; .
Support for research and innovation is vital for peripheral regions within the Union if they are to stay competitive in an increasingly globalised world .
We have tried to get this incomplete and therefore incorrect report taken off the agenda , unfortunately without success .
I share the concerns expressed by my fellow Member and draw attention to the need , which is more pressing than ever , for appropriate measures to be taken to guarantee all citizens access to healthy , nutritious food , whether they are resident within the European Union or elsewhere in the world .
This is a feeling felt by many Member States with regard to the Schengen area and we should not rush with further expansion before all involved are fully and sufficiently ready and prepared .
( ES ) Mr President , we will see if I can bring a little calm to this fierce debate .
It is essential that the EU supports the ILO as an institution and that we take the ILO &apos;s conventions seriously .
The other Member States have indicated they are willing to listen to the reasons for that &apos; no &apos; , to take account of it and to move forward on that basis .
If I had to praise something , to give a very positive assessment to one thing in the excellent report produced by Mr Millán Mon , it is precisely this : that it places transatlantic relations within the orbit of the Treaty of Lisbon for us and sets out all the major mechanisms provided by the Treaty of Lisbon so that the European Union can maintain relations on first-name terms with the United States .
Coming back to the Commission &apos;s position , I think we have been asked very straightforward questions about how this change should be administered and through which instrument .
Something is fundamentally wrong here .
First , regarding our priorities for 2010 to 2020 and the launch of the European industrial initiatives , those six initiatives really match our priorities - wind , solar bio-energy , sustainable fission , smart grids , and carbon capture and storage are priorities that were strongly endorsed by Parliament and the Council .
That is why I will vote against the report .
All this calls for a profound change in the CAP that will guarantee food security and sovereignty , giving priority to the need for countries and regions to develop production to meet their needs , while promoting environmental sustainability and rural development ; promote more diversified production and prevent it from diminishing , while recognising the specific characters of the different sectors and regions ; surpass , through modelling and capping aid , the current imbalances between products , producers and countries and finally foresee intervention mechanisms to ensure fair prices for production and to provide farmers with a level of income that will ensure the continuity of production and regular food supplies .
Respect for fundamental human rights must be the key objective of all European policies and must be given the most attention by the three countries which are going to hold the EU Presidency during the next 18 months .
Consequently , we must abandon this fiction ; we must abandon this masquerade of accession and immediately begin practical discussions , in other words aim for a partnership built on our mutual and reciprocal interests .
I would be interested to know whether you actually see yourself as representing a small group of people in the United Kingdom or whether you feel at all that you are a representative of the European Union ?
Allow me also to make a brief digression on behalf of a Member State which , in a sense , I represented until six weeks ago - because now I do not represent a Member State - but until six weeks ago , I represented a Member State that held a different opinion on the issue of the patent .
There have been delays in getting the new institutions going ; there must not be any delay in getting the answers going that Europeans expect from the next Council .
We cannot allow the economic crisis to make the situation of these children worse .
You should raise the matter again when Mr Pöttering is in the chair .
Visas are an instrument included in the framework of immigration policies ; their purpose is to legalise the entry and temporary stay in a country where the applicant is neither a non-national nor a resident .
It should be made quite clear that none of the outermost regions , whether it be Madeira , where I come from , or one of the other eight outermost regions , particularly the Canary Islands , which are by far the worst affected , is against the conclusion of these types of agreements .
There is a danger , during this period , that the countries to which my fellow members referred and which do not set particular store by this sector , will try to limit the role of the UN .
More importantly , this would make a real difference on the ground at a time when it is very much needed .
For this reason , I voted against both point 20 and the whole report .
A total of 62 % of those surveyed are concerned that data protection is being disregarded in the case of personalised advertising and data protection specialists also have misgivings , because personal data is being stored , compared and linked with other data .
In particular , the high cereal prices exacerbate the problems for profitability amongst winter beef finishers , who have a higher dependency on cereal-based feed imports .
Elmar Brok proposed that responsibility be transferred from the Bureau , which meets in private , to the Parliament , which meets in public .
We must demonstrate clearly - and , in my opinion , this also concerns the question of the election of the Commission President - that we are making use of our rights and we must send a clear signal to the Commission .
( DE ) Mr President , now that the urgent matter has been removed from the agenda , I would like to ask you to divide the speaking time for the Western Sahara item between the other two urgent matters , as we had some tough discussions yesterday about the speaking time for urgent matters .
It is hard to understand the lack of awareness of the need to have a single anti-discrimination law which would protect the equal treatment of all people and not just of select social groups .
A further deepening of this cooperation , including the EUR 15 million budget for MEDIA 2011-2013 , will broaden the choice for consumers and will bring more culturally diverse products into the European and international market .
That is why , having accepted the Secretary-General &apos;s report on party funding and his proposal to create a statute and the European Parliament &apos;s proposal in the previous 2003 report on the need for such a statute - except that the Treaty of Lisbon had not yet been adopted then - and , finally , the Bureau &apos;s decision of 10 January , the Committee on Constitutional Affairs , following a serious hearing with all the political parties , chairmen and secretaries at European level and distinguished professors of economic and constitutional law and following a hearing of Transparency International and the EU Court of Auditors , approved this report , which calls on the European Commission to table a corresponding proposal , so that we can have a real European statute for political parties .
My entire group is united in rejecting the idea of using the Community &apos;s budget to promote a more militarist and neoliberal European Union .
With consensus seemingly breaking out between Parliament and Council , I was pleased to be able to support the Council &apos;s text and the agreed amendments , even if the latter were , in the end , not adopted .
in writing . - In a highly globalised world , farmers face increasing pressure .
The Commission and Member States must ensure that the necessary funds are earmarked for Ecolabel awareness and promotion campaigns .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the history of asbestos is a sad one and a cautionary tale of what can happen when the precautionary principle is ignored .
We need this service now , for example , during the discussions on climate change in Copenhagen .
The Commission welcomed that ruling as a contribution to fair competition and as an important foundation for strengthening media pluralism .
First of all , I think that the elements of the Commission &apos;s proposal relating to the sales , service and repair market are very much aligned with the consumer interests which we have raised in our committee - not specifically on issues related to DG Competition , but for example particularly in the areas related to information on service and repair where we worked , in this instance , with the Environment Committee on the provisions concerning technical information linked to environmental standards for motor vehicles .
In the context of the crisis , problems such as unemployment , poverty and social exclusion are the order of the day .
Other actors , too - this Parliament , all 27 Member States , the regional authorities , the national Parliaments , the local authorities and every municipality in the European Union - play a very important role in the effective development of European citizenship .
Furthermore , on 30 June last year , the Commission adopted a specific communication on tourism , which proposes - in line with the Treaty of Lisbon and the new Europe 2020 strategy - a consolidated political framework to strengthen competitiveness in the sector , with the aim of making European tourism a truly competitive , modern , sustainable and responsible industry .
A further undoubtedly important aspect of the partnership is Brazil &apos;s role as one of the leaders in the process of regional integration through Unasur .
It will be these paths that lead us to the point where the Europe 2020 strategy can , in fact , go beyond being a paper initiative and become reality , supporting small and medium-sized enterprises , which are the major employers in the European economy , supporting businesses in general , and creating an idea of sustained growth in the economy , which can be based more and more on the internal market , on economic governance that actually works and , essentially , on an idea of real growth for our economy .
The fact that Member States will be obliged to require businesses to develop annual business plans for gender equality and to guarantee a balanced gender distribution on corporate boards of management is diametrically opposed to the freedom of running a business .
Ladies and gentlemen , I believe that what took place in the Committee of the Regions was a serious and harmful violation of the rights of an EU Member State .
We need to give ourselves the scope to think ahead and think big .
Mr President , &apos; violence &apos; , &apos; a high number of casualties &apos; , &apos; hundreds dead and wounded in China in the uprising in Xinjiang province &apos; : those were the alarming reports we received 10 days ago .
General Motors is not closing Opel Belgium because it is in difficulties : it has made a EUR 3.4 million profit , but this has not prevented it from getting rid of 2 600 jobs .
Those parties are in favour of taking a hard line rather than relying on seemingly endless and ineffective peace talks .
( FR ) Mr President , Mr Bokros , since you have raised the issue , I am going to continue .
It is also important for us to stress that all states and international organisations , including ΝΑΤΟ , should refrain from the threat and use of any manner of violence , which is out of keeping with the aims and principles of the charter founding the UN .
I believe - in response to what I took to be a call from the Council and a wish of Mr Zwiefka - that , as we have worked well together , so far as it depends on me , we will have an agreement at first reading tomorrow .
It is worth highlighting the agreement between the EU , Iceland , Liechtenstein and Norway and the agreement between the EU and Norway , two financial mechanisms for 2009-2014 which provide for a total package of EUR 1.8 billion , representing a 31 % increase in the EEA financial mechanism and a 22 % increase in the Norwegian financial mechanism against the previous period .
I should like to offer my congratulations on the excellent work carried out by Mr Klinz .
An excellent example of this is the Services Directive .
I have not taken up a position on this subject .
While I concede that President Rajapaksa may have lost some international goodwill through some of his emergency actions in the immediate aftermath of the conflict , I am convinced that the best way forward is to guarantee the development of a secure and prosperous Sri Lanka and support its democratically-elected leader and government .
Mr President , I would like to begin by thanking all of my fellow Members for the excellent cooperation and for a very constructive debate .
On 26 April 2010 , the Committee on Fisheries and the Legal Service of the European Parliament expressed serious doubts about the legal basis chosen by the Commission to draw up the agreement .
Sometimes I have difficulty in understanding why , immediately the word &apos; NATO &apos; is mentioned , people - perhaps because of their anti-American feelings , or because they have anti-military leanings - are against it .
The final death toll is still unknown , as the soldiers also collected the bodies rather than allow them to be counted at public morgues .
I would like to assure you that we are following in the footsteps of the revolutionaries of 1956 and intend to serve the cause of European unity through their ideals and faith .
In order for trade liberation to have a substantial positive effect on the whole region , it is essential that ECOWAS sign a full EPA .
The people certainly know that the EU is not the Soviet Union .
The prosecution rests .
Already giving a final deadline for banning animal testing would be ill-advised and perhaps even hazardous to human health ; I agree with the rapporteur on this .
Let us not forget that governments such as those of the USA and Britain have for years supported , armed and kept in power the well-known monstrous dictatorship of the Shah of Iran .
The objective of the SMA , was supposed to give implementation to the Monti report which had as main concern to re-launch the Single Market .
Either we move towards a common destiny , or we must resign ourselves to succumbing to the negative dynamic of national selfishness and destructive competition between ourselves .
Modification of Regulation ( EC ) No 1234 / 2007 ( the &apos; Single CMO Regulation &apos; ) ( debate )
I would like to thank Parliament again , not only for its contribution in voting on and adopting the Services Directive , but also for acting as a watchdog and continuing to push the Council and the Commission to do what we can in order for it to come into place .
He knows as well as I do where the cost will lie - it will end up with the taxpayer having to fund this .
The milk surplus must be stemmed at national level by imposing European requirements .
It would be a great shame if this document had to suffer from this problem .
on behalf of the ALDE Group . - Madam President , in Iraq , the death penalty was suspended after the US-led invasion in 2003 but reintroduced in August 2004 .
This is , therefore , a clear justification for the common agricultural policy .
If there are no objections , the name may be registered .
in writing . - I am disappointed that the resolution supported by my own group today was not adopted .
I want to stress that what comes very clearly out of the report is the message that humanitarian principles , international humanitarian law and protection of the humanitarian space have to be at the centre of our action on the consensus .
Let us reject the idea , cherished by some , that profits are divided privately , but losses are shared by society .
Mr Ford raised some of the issues about bilateral relations .
For this reason , European products are not well protected within these states &apos; national systems , with the risk of counterfeiting occurring .
The Commission had to launch infringement procedures against most Member States concerning the obligation to establish inventories of large PCB-containing equipment and PCB disposal plans .
( DE ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , adapting the rules on vaccination for bluetongue is in accordance with the new EU vaccination policy as expressed in the Animal Health strategy 2007-2013 under the slogan &apos; Prevention is better than cure &apos; .
I deplore that innocent civilians are used as human shields .
We have already seen this in Iran .
The way Members of this House , across all political groups , have responded to date has been extremely heartening .
Mr President , honourable Members , I want to thank you for a very professional and constructive debate , and Mr Deutsch for his excellent report .
I find this solution to be pointless and superficial .
We have traceability on paper , so it will be possible .
The G20 labour and social welfare ministers should ask for the support granted to companies in difficulty , as a result of the economic crisis , to be extended until when the unemployment rate starts to fall again .
They did not like &apos; traditional rosé &apos; exactly for the reason you said - that it was a bit old fashioned .
The Committee on International Trade did not question any of these things as an obstacle to taking the debate into their own hands and voting on this issue , and took on board all these late changes from both the Commission and the Council .
The EU &apos;s accession to the Convention also opens up the question of the political representation of the Union in the bodies of the Council of Europe .
I have just come back from the site of the accident where I witnessed both the catastrophic impact of the red sludge on people , homes , land and the ecology of the region , and the significant efforts of the Hungarian response teams .
However , in order to have a strong agriculture , we must also have a strong welfare policy , because I believe the future of European agriculture is very much of a high-quality product and one that has very good welfare standards .
I have voted in favour of Mrs Gebhardt &apos;s report , because I hope that the implementation of the Services Directive will provide a new stimulus for the labour market .
I believe that the oral amendment is well worded and allows us a great deal of free scope and I therefore ask you to support it .
It seems clear to me that this is a Europe for bankers .
In my opinion , it is equally important to establish the procedures and structures which will protect development as an independent area of policy with its own specific objectives .
This European instrument will make it possible to grant micro-credits to small enterprises and to people who have lost their jobs and want to set up their own small businesses .
This is the price to be paid for health .
( DE ) Madam President , I believe that the budget poses us a challenge every year , requiring us to be thrifty with resources on the one hand , while also using these resources efficiently on the other .
Thus , all any illegal immigrant will have to do to get into Europe is to say that he is the victim of a network that is extorting thousands of euros from him .
In its most recent report on these matters ( February 2011 ) , the Commission stated that Bulgaria needed to improve further the way the judiciary , police and other investigative bodies are structured , managed and cooperate .
( HU ) Madam President , the Treaty on the European Union states that the European Union is based on respect for freedom , democracy , rule of law and human rights .
The introduction of environmental economic accounts is fundamentally important , but is no substitute for the creation of alternative indicators to GDP which cover the various environmental and social dimensions .
If I drive for one more minute in a country because I need to move my car , I could be faced with sky-high fines in a different country weeks later .
Against this backdrop , the Member States and the European Union have just made it quite clear what European solidarity means : sweeping the continued looting of financial capital under the carpet and , if necessary , transferring the costs of the theft onto the workers and ordinary people through measures of true social terrorism .
The proposal to simplify the CAP is part of the wider process of reducing bureaucratic procedures , a process initiated some time ago by various EU Member States , to ensure more efficient and accessible services for citizens .
The European Union is both the main investor in Latin America and an important trading partner .
Naturally we cannot speak of democracy when not every citizen has the right , regardless of their financial standing , to use the Internet .
This is also an integral part of any democracy .
Despite their obligations , Member States are delaying transposition and are also carrying out transposition incorrectly .
At the General Assembly Third Committee , the EU also achieved its chief objectives : resolutions on Burma , DPRK and the death penalty were all passed with increased majorities - as was the Canadian resolution on Iran - and the EU resolution on eliminating religious intolerance again met with consensus .
This is my final speech before this House .
Mr President , this is the second time that I have sat in this Chamber and seen the President interrupt one of the speakers on the basis that they are speaking too quickly .
The batteries and their life are still far too limited and contain extremely harmful substances .
Since the attempts to create unitary patent protection throughout the EU have failed to fulfil expectations , and in view of the fact that all of the legal preconditions stipulated for enhanced cooperation in the area of creating individual patent protection are fulfilled , I agree with the European Parliament giving its consent .
The 2007-2013 rural development programme for Greece , cofinanced by the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development , does not contain a guarantee fund for small and very small enterprises as it stands .
I think this situation - one of a certain crisis in relations between Parliament and the Council - points to the need for the European Parliament to put greater pressure on the Council concerning greater transparency over budgetary expenditure .
We must somehow manage to talk to the people directly , because in contrast to what the Earl of Dartmouth has once again said , there are many people in this region who are not interested in European Union money , but who want to move from a region of hate and war into a union of peace and understanding .
( DE ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I would like first of all to thank the Commissioner for his speech , but also for his bold actions over the last few weeks and months concerning the car industry and his clear statement that a solution must be found for General Motors , because the company is needed , in particular in relation to the strategy on new drive systems .
Ensure that we have binding energy efficiency targets that are actually complied with .
in writing . - ( PL ) I voted to adopt the report with recommendations to the Commission on a European initiative for the development of micro-credits in support of growth and employment .
( LT ) Mr President , I agree with the specific action proposed in the initiative on Alzheimer &apos;s disease , that it is essential to promote early diagnosis and quality of life , to support cooperation between the Member States through sharing best practices and clinical studies , and to respect the rights of people living with this difficult disease .
Germany and Austria are a poor example in this regard , but so , unfortunately , are others .
I do not think we have done this in the past and I hope we will not do so in the future , either .
They are normally cooperation activities that do not involve any coordination in competitive behaviour by the market parties , so they have no effect on competitiveness , but promote gains which would otherwise be impossible .
That is why , for instance , in this special package , we have approved a European economic recovery plan .
So that this can indeed be done , I call on the Council , the Commission and you , ladies and gentlemen , to take steps to ensure that European consumers can no longer be misled in this way .
In addition , for me , the question of responsibility also quite naturally arises in this connection .
A total of 702 redundancies at 82 textile firms justifies the Spanish authorities &apos; application to mobilise the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund .
They reach people via meat .
That is why we , as Parliament , decided that we not only wanted to make the legislation , but that we also wanted to monitor how the Services Directive is actually transposed in the Member States .
I think that it is high time to move away from these dilemmatic Manichaeisms and to make clear points concerning our wish to engage in a constructive and efficient dialogue with Russia .
I voted in favour , as I consider that every EU nation must feel itself to be part of the system of a united European Union .
The initiatives have to be taken at local level and benefit from the expertise of local NGOs and Roma themselves who know what the main difficulties are , so that this strategy really meets Roma people &apos;s needs .
Simultaneously , the European Parliament is reiterating its demand to be kept informed about all the relevant developments in this field , and is playing an active part , which is its prerogative .
I believe that a joint solution will be found , especially after the meeting this morning with both Mrs Ashton and Commissioner Piebalgs , and I , too , seriously believe that if the political will is there , the legal obstacles will be overcome .
It can therefore contribute to greater compliance with the Directive and to greater awareness of the Community legislation on equal treatment of men and women .
It must never happen again .
Europe must , however , remain competitive in this sector and continue prospecting for gas so that it can diversify its energy sources .
And of course in our daily existence we know there are hundreds of thousands of animals that we are happy to have killed , either to eat them or to use their products in other ways .
Specifically , the Commission intends to make budgetary surveillance and policy coordination more forward-looking .
With this wide range of stakeholders we are working together to implement the plan and are developing the coordination and cooperation mechanisms to do so .
Time is not our friend in this and , at the end of the day , if we want to have a solution and if we are backing the number one position called for by Mr Hökmark , then we need to go as quickly as possible in that direction .
In addition , the Commission is delaying in implementing the commitments it assumed in this communication .
I hope that the European Council adopts the planned strategy in June .
Finally , I would like to report on the issues which were given to the Hungarian Presidency as homework by the previous European Councils , and more specifically : what results and achievements will be presented at the summit starting tomorrow , because , after all , we had to make a deal about specific dossiers with you and we had to reach agreement on other issues as well .
in writing . - ( IT ) Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , I voted in favour of Mr Onesta &apos;s report on revision of the Rules of Procedure with regard to the petitions process .
We need to reject once and for all the misplaced belief that man has the dangers posed by nuclear energy under control .
In future , the simplification process may be extended to other European programmes , notably , the structural funds .
As the rapporteur points out , the financial impact of irregularities on structural actions has decreased significantly .
the oral question to the Council on the Small Business Act ( SBA ) review by Bendt Bendtsen , on behalf of the PPE Group , Edit Herczog , on behalf of the S &amp; D Group , Fiona Hall , on behalf of the ALDE Group , Reinhard Bütikofer , on behalf of the Verts / ALE Group , Giles Chichester , on behalf of the ECR Group , and Niki Tzavela , on behalf of the EFD Group - B7-0301 / 2011 ) ,
Paraphrasing Miguel Hernández , &apos; We have to speak about many things &apos; , or from the poetry of Vallejo , quoted in Stockholm this past week by Vargas Llosa , &apos; Brothers , there is much to do &apos; , in this Europe ...
As far as the objectives of the European Investment Bank are concerned , I would like to see a greater focus on its activities within Europe .
I would also like to draw your attention to a view which has been voiced many times today , namely , that the balance in the Western Balkan countries is very delicate .
Furthermore , it must be stressed that although they are very different structures , both the European Union and the OSCE follow the same principles and values , that is to say , respect for human rights and democracy .
The proposed regulation establishes the procedure for setting the maximum permitted limits of radioactive contamination for foodstuffs and animal feed which may be put on the market following a nuclear accident or any other case of radiological emergency , which may cause or has caused significant radioactive contamination of foodstuffs and animal feed .
Finally , the points where I disagree with some Members .
I actually believe that the goals for category A ships to come into line by 2016 and the even later deadline set for category B , C and D ships are too lenient and give the carriers too much leeway .
In other words , it is a worse version of the recipe which led the EU into the crisis and recession and drastically exacerbated its social problems .
It would be good if the Commission , Ms Catherine Ashton and the Council thought this through .
If you drink pure alcohol , we know what happens .
Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting
I am cautious of the recommendation of the Czech Presidency to make childcare &apos; a fully valid alternative to a professional career &apos; .
I do not want cohesion policy to overlook the specific needs of the social groups with the most difficulties , as that is not compatible with an integrated approach or with a more strategic concept that is investing in the sectors of the future .
The Commission also continues to follow closely the closure case against the DTP currently pending in the Constitutional Court .
Appointments to committees ( proposal by the Conference of Presidents ) : see Minutes
The measures will combine increased energy efficiency with lower costs .
What would happen to Europe &apos;s reputation ?
in writing . - ( DE ) I have voted in favour of the report , because it makes a significant contribution to reducing bureaucracy , which is something that is constantly being called for , and allows more than 20 directives that are obsolete or no longer needed to be repealed .
In order to have a real European response we should have had a European framework for helping Greece out of its debt crisis , instead of doing it through bilateral loans .
On behalf of the Commission , I highly appreciate the fact that today we are commemorating the Roma genocide victims as well .
( SK ) We are talking here today about a project that is unique ; we are talking about our common European foreign service .
Compliance with nuclear safety standards and protection for the population against nuclear risk are particularly important aspects which justify the funding granted by the European Union to the three Member States for decommissioning their nuclear power stations , which could have no longer been modernised to meet the highest safety standards .
However , I would like to stress that providing this safety , to which patients are entitled , must not be used as a justification for price increases .
With this in mind , we should appreciate the amendments adopted by Parliament to the Commission &apos;s proposal which , in particular , concern strengthening the common market , reducing protectionism , continuing Cohesion policy and supporting agriculture .
in writing . - ( LT ) The social economy helps to implement the four main goals of EU employment policy : to improve opportunities for residents to find work ; to encourage enterprise , especially by creating local jobs ; to improve the ability of companies and employees to adapt , in particular by modernising work organisation ; and to strengthen equal opportunities policies , first of all by organising public policy measures , which help to reconcile work and family life .
Then , in the health check , we had the discussion on increasing the quotas to try to find a soft landing for the dairy farmers .
As far as I know from sources in Bulgaria , there is a very low percentage of referrals to prosecutors , of which very few lead to convictions .
( IT ) Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , Commissioner , today we find ourselves discussing organ transplants , which is , without doubt , one of the most positive aspects of progress in the sphere of health , but which also opens up a series of problems concerning the rights of the donor and the patient , which must be dealt with on ethical , social , legal and economic levels .
We supported this agreement with an overwhelming majority in Parliament , and we consider it very important for the aforementioned reasons .
Sixthly , was there any reliance upon self-certifying of safety of feed mills and , if so , why - since that should only be permissible on small-scale operators - was it allowed to apply here ?
On the other hand , the important question is , of course , whether we should tighten up the safety provisions .
So I am grateful for the comments I have heard and for the messages I can convey to other partners in the G20 group .
The countries of the former Eastern bloc , moreover , experienced the change of regime as a trauma as well , but in this case , we are all equally threatened by the global financial and economic crisis which , in spite of certain early signs , was nonetheless unexpected .
This highly important area can be the key to a successful and sustainable Europe and , in my opinion , has been seriously neglected in recent months .
One of these measures , however , was also giving Directorates-General the ability to suspend payments for up to six months in justified cases .
This is precisely why the Development Cooperation Instrument must continue this fight in developing countries as well , by making a significant contribution to guaranteeing a decent living for as many citizens as possible .
These demands of the European Parliament are persistent and stubborn , but they are not an expression of malice on the part of MEPs , they are an expression of concern for public money and are , as indeed they should be , an expression of concern for transparency in spending taxpayers &apos; money .
Mr President , the European External Action Service will be responsible to the High Representative .
The proposal takes the rights and needs of disabled persons and persons with reduced mobility into due account , particularly with regard to non-discriminatory access to transport , the rights to compensation in the event of loss of , or damage to , mobility equipment , submission and handling of complaints , disability-related training for staff on buses or coaches , and information to be provided during the journey .
The G20 is self-proclaimed ; it operates without written rules and is a club of rich nations which have surrounded themselves with a few so-called emerging countries , including such exemplary democracies as Saudi Arabia .
Talking about the fragility of the government right now and the situation in Moldova , we have to remember experiences at the beginning of the 1990s in this country , when the difficult economic situation led to a failure to pay pensions and salaries and to a break in reforms .
That applies to governments as well as to individuals .
It also stressed the need for sufficient resources for proper monitoring and support to EU producers .
Part of the problem is that interpretation of the myriad rules can vary from one inspector to another .
This report provides a statistical summary about irregularities reported by the Member States in those areas where they implement the budget ( agricultural policy , cohesion policy and pre-accession funds , i.e. around 80 % of the budget ) and about the collection of the EU &apos;s traditional own resources .
The United Nations High Commission for Refugees puts a figure on that population : 200 000 refugees per year .
I therefore welcome the commitment of the candidates to work to the highest principles of transparency , including disclosing the outcome of regulatory meetings with lobbyists and industry representatives .
There should be only one budget priority - slash spending and stop robbing Britain .
I understand why the proposal was submitted , but I do not agree with the reasons for submitting it .
in writing . - I voted in favour of this resolution which welcomes the Commission White Paper on an EU strategy for climate change adaptation and proposes a range of measures across several policy fields .
In voting in favour of the motion for a resolution on the situation in Tunisia , I want first of all to express my solidarity with the Tunisian people who , driven by legitimate democratic aspirations and the will to improve their country &apos;s social situation , have brought it to an historic political turning point .
I will keep the European Parliament constantly informed of the progress made on Haiti reconstruction .
Second , we have to enhance crisis management and conflict prevention .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , Beijing &apos;s justification for the arrest of the artist Ai Weiwei for economic crimes is not convincing , and neither is the need to treat a free , dissident artist so harshly .
We therefore believe this oral question and the developments that it may entail to be of particular importance .
Obviously , all this is going to upset a few habits .
I believe in the positive impact of simplifying and improving the existing regulatory framework for the labelling of textile products , particularly encouraging the development and uptake of new fibres .
The response , of necessity , involves Europe , and our Committee on Industry , Research and Energy supports Mr Trakatellis in his desire to strengthen research and prevention .
I am astonished by the negative stance taken by my Socialist colleagues in this respect .
Hence , I call on the Commission to carefully assess the opportunity for a completely independent credit rating foundation , which should be provided with seed funds to cover a maximum of five years .
Of course , we need to ensure that Israel can preserve its democratic system and its rights in its own capital , and the European Union can be involved in the peace process , and it should be , but in a diplomatic role and not as a doctor or judge .
Europe &apos;s biodiversity is the most precious legacy which we can leave future generations .
Based on a top-down approach , research and innovation will be the main areas for identifying solutions aimed at overcoming the problems which we are facing and for boosting economic growth and sustainable development .
In an economic downturn , it is all the more important for people to acquire those skills that will improve their employability during but also after the crisis .
So perhaps we should be grateful to the EU for introducing this .
We must have our doors wide open to using low-carbon technologies and to developing new ones .
In conclusion , I should like to remind the House that many wars on this earth hit many women particularly hard , and we are working to prevent the use of harassment and rape of women as weapons of war .
I believe that we have to put all our experience , all the lessons we have learnt in Haiti and elsewhere , and also enough money , into the pot .
Mr President , I beg you , do not remain deaf to the demands of the intergroups and to all the letters that have been addressed to you over recent years .
I think we need more than that .
Every unexpected and premature death is , more than anything , a tragedy for the families concerned , but when victims are numbered in tens or hundreds of thousands , it is also a tragedy for entire nations and the whole world .
I also need to stress that EU decision makers are under pressure to make rapid progress in this field .
Therefore , we need sensible , wide-ranging protection for consumers , but it is also important for us to take the interests of small and medium-sized enterprises into consideration .
Belarus has taken measures that are unquestionably along the lines of more democracy .
on behalf of the ALDE Group . - Mr President , it is not only because of the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women that , when we consider a resolution on this matter , we should ask whether we have done enough .
To call these missions embassies would compound the fear that the EU is seeking all the trappings of a sovereign state .
I have received seven motions for resolution tabled in accordance with Rule 110 ( 2 ) of the Rules of Procedure .
I voted in favour of it , because Croatia should become a Member State in the near future .
On the basis of this report , the main objective of the radio spectrum policy programme is broadband coverage by 2013 for all citizens of Europe , and high speed Internet by 2020 .
I deplore the fact that the Commission only presented these financing needs in Amending Letter No 2 / 2010 after Parliament &apos;s first reading , in other words , after Parliament had set its priorities .
The report I am presenting seeks to tackle this contradiction and suggests possible answers for the other institutions .
This report concerns the 19 initiatives proposed by the Commission which will put European citizens at the heart of the internal market and , at the same time , will work towards a sustainable social market economy .
I voted against the report by Mr Roszkowski on complementarities and coordination of cohesion policy with rural development measures .
We must be fair : there is a vast difference between industrial fishing and traditional fishing techniques .
The EU does not support , and will not accept , ACTA creating an obligation to disconnect people from the Internet because of illegal downloads .
( ES ) Mr President , like my fellow Members , I also wish to congratulate Mr Füle on having taken office and I hope that the excellent impression he made in his Committee on Foreign Affairs hearing will be confirmed over the course of his mandate , particularly in the sensitive area of enlargement .
Mr President , this Brok report is positive proof of the emergence of a single European Union superstate .
Since the financial markets were hit hard by the crisis , it is important to restore confidence , which is largely happening through the role to be performed by the supervisory authorities , which have to exercise their mandate with competence and efficiency in order to signal the necessary confidence to investors and companies .
With today &apos;s vote on the joint motion for a resolution on the 10th anniversary of UN Security Council resolution 1325 ( 2000 ) on women , peace and security , we wish to give a tangible sign of our commitment as MEPs but , above all , as European citizens .
This was also the underlying idea of the founding fathers of the Economic and Monetary Union .
Here in the European Parliament , we have a process of legislation which , although highly complex , is one of the most transparent when compared to national parliaments .
the report by Mr Böge , on behalf of the Committee on Budgets , on the financial framework 2007-2013 : the European Economic Recovery Plan , second revision ( amendment of the Interinstitutional Agreement of 17 May 2006 on budgetary discipline and sound financial management ) - C7-0305 / 2009 - .
We cannot allow this to happen .
It is also about smart grids , the integration of renewable energy and sustainable transport - hydrogen buses , electric vehicles .
When pursuing its economic interests , the EU itself has a responsibility to support activists like Ai Weiwei , Liu Xiaobo and Hu Jun , who have fought courageously for urgent political reform in China , against oppression , and for human rights and fundamental freedoms .
Fostering the solidarity economy is one way of improving the situation .
We also must have stricter rules in order to protect workers , better monitoring and strengthening of the powers of investigation by the competent authorities in order to be able to carry out regular assessments of nuclear safety , enquiries and inspections .
( ES ) Madam President , Commissioner , I am pleased with the question that we are debating today , but I think that it only covers one of the possible cases where a company ceases to operate : that of financial collapse or insolvency .
Secondly , it requires a solution to the matter of copyright in the case of orphan and out-of-print works .
For implementation and absorption to be better , it is essential to have continuous simplification and continuous liberalisation of the legislation which governs implementation of this policy .
At the same time , we must establish that the prisoners there should not be regarded as peaceful human rights campaigners and that they must be judged on that basis .
Members of the European Parliament , led by Gay Mitchell , made an important contribution to that summit and I thank them very much for their participation and support .
On the other hand , the Council does not exclude the possibility of deciding to adopt an alternative technical solution which can achieve the objectives proposed by SIS II .
Further delays carry with them budgetary , political , legal and even socio-economic consequences .
President-in-Office of the Council . - Mr President , the Presidency , building on the work carried out by the French Presidency , is pursuing actively discussions on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the application of patients &apos; rights in cross-border health care .
In 2008 , the Commission tabled a draft Council regulation on the conservation of fish stocks through technical measures , which aimed to replace a previous regulation .
Show them , Madam President , that Christian refugees in Cyprus are entitled to celebrate mass in their churches .
For this reason , I am very pleased to accept the adoption of the resolution on harmonised conditions for the marketing of construction products .
On the eve of the launch of the Eastern Partnership we need to demonstrate that we are indeed ready to assist Moldova in overcoming the current difficulties , in particular by defusing tensions , promoting dialogue and strengthening links between us .
Mr President , another point concerns actual customs checks by Member States .
Member States must take their own ethical decision on this .
Therefore , the first general question that I would ask the Commission is : how will the Commission act to ensure overall consistency on the issue of forests - 2011 is the International Year of Forests - while taking account of what was said in Nagoya and what was decided in Cancún , in particular , on the REDD + mechanism , and taking account too of the trade agreements that have been negotiated , which are sometimes responsible for deforestation through liberalising trade in timber ?
This , too , is nothing new ; it is also contained in the other directives .
Member of the Commission . - Mr President , as we have seen once again today , Parliament &apos;s debates on this matter are both rich and passionate .
We will certainly continue to work very closely with this House .
This is why we are calling on Member States and shipowners to make efforts to obtain a place on the white list of the Paris Memorandum of Understanding .
Of course , this requires cooperation with other countries , especially China , India and Russia .
Mr President , Mrs Malmström , Mr Barroso , before I look at the institutional issues , I would like to make a brief remark about Copenhagen .
However , it is particularly the case for small holdings , where the input of bureaucracy is sometimes quite simply disproportionate to the output represented by the money received .
Yes , we will now have the bills of rights where the citizens will know that they can go to the courts in order to have their rights taken seriously .
The Single Market must be relaunched and completed in order to meet the objectives set in the Europe 2020 strategy so as to offer more growth for businesses , including social economy enterprises ( cooperatives , associations , mutual societies and foundations ) and create more and better jobs , as well as provide adequate protection for the rights of European workers and consumers .
If we want to prevent such houses of cards from being built in future , the only thing to do is to ban the risky financial products .
This is an EU success .
In the European Union , we have a strong desire for the Guantánamo Bay detention centre to be permanently closed , and we welcome the fact that President Obama is persisting in his commitment to do so .
Yet it would be good if the EU were to take a flexible yet consistent position within the framework of its current powers , for example , by ensuring that the rules apply as much to Germany as they do to Flanders , that the larger Member States do not get away with more than the smaller ones .
We urge all colleagues to stick to the joint text and reject any amendments .
Given the significant profits that both parties will be able to make , I hope that the negotiations between the EU and India will be able to continue , with a view to quickly establishing a free trade agreement ( FTA ) which is ambitious , balanced and comprehensive .
Revision of the Treaties - Transitional measures concerning the composition of the European Parliament - Decision not to convene a Convention for the revision of the Treaties with regard to transitional measures concerning the composition of the European Parliament ( debate )
We need to lead jointly by example , to get China and India on board in a multilateral agreement and to launch an integrated carbon market as part of the future global market .
The variety of the fishing grounds found in the EU is part of our strength , but consequently an additional complication when producing legislation that is adequate , responsive and coherent .
All efforts should now be focused on the achievement of a peaceful transfer of power .
I hope the path is clear and that the FTT and a balanced system of economic policy coordination are beyond mere surveillance and common debt management .
The scientific reports concerning the current biomass of bluefin tuna are alarmist : uncontrolled industrial-scale fishing has severely eroded stocks .
This is why the European Union must act in order to follow up on this distortion of the internal market .
This is a useful product used right across the United Kingdom and Europe for the manufacture of a number of products .
Nevertheless , the triumph of &apos; communautarianism &apos; requires that each and every national of each and every Member State feels fairly treated on the basis of their merits .
Economic governance and national economic policy should be more a matter of common concern for all the parties involved .
I think that is exactly what we should be focusing on .
I am glad that those aspects of the budget are gradually representing a greater proportion of the budget , and agriculture and some others are declining .
What does the Commission think about establishing a genuine fund that is on a par with the others , to meet all the needs of the EGF without restricting the role of the European Parliament which has been so involved in this issue ?
It is very important to constantly inform European citizens about the achievements of the internal market and the benefits it provides so that they know what rights and opportunities they are offered by the European Union and one of its cornerstones - the common internal market .
In Europe there are several mining projects using cyanide .
It is regrettable that the report does not lay down methods of settling conflicts of competency , determining which state should exercise jurisdiction .
There is a need for a concerted and coherent economic and financial policy between the Member States of the euro area : a true &apos; pact for the euro &apos; .
The most recent statistical framework shows a steady increase in requests received from Member States in favour of a fund that operates with a different degree of flexibility .
Although the EU 2020 objectives are defined at Community level , it is vital that the local and regional authorities are involved more in their implementation ; a bottom-up approach is essential if we are to implement the economic objectives of the EU 2020 strategy efficiently .
People who can get secondary school education would prefer to live in their countries rather to beg in Europe .
For the immediate future , the EU and the Member States should focus their resources on finding the source of the contamination in order to end the outbreak and the deaths that it has caused , and to restore consumer confidence in the food chain , as without this , it is impossible to put an end to our farmers &apos; desperation .
I think it gave a good indication of the strength of feeling in the House and perhaps an indication also that you can count on many Members here to vote for quite radical reform .
The report shows where the effort should be intensified .
Irrespective of the results of the Copenhagen talks , the EU must carry on and lay down and implement effective targets for the reduction of emissions , develop new clean technologies and commit itself to climate justice , so that developing countries will not be saddled with reaping what the developed world sowed .
So we need to address the security gap but also to do this in a way that ensures full respect of fundamental rights and a sufficient level of data protection .
I have a feeling that the Empire is striking back .
The answer is thus to have more democracy and not more far-right politics , hostility towards people and cynical contempt for people .
We also need to consider - and that would be a task for your successor , whether that is you or someone else - how we in Europe , on the one hand , can be in favour of a number of large projects , such as Nabucco and Desertec , while at the same time advocating the decentralisation of some of our electricity and energy production .
It is just over a year since the tragedy in Haiti , in which more than 200 000 people lost their lives and more than 3 million Haitians were affected .
A new party , the National Front for Democracy , which may be eligible , consists partly of former leaders of the National League for Democracy , in other words , the former party of Aung San Suu Kyi ;
Mr Salafranca &apos;s report includes an integrated programme and proposes the creation of a foundation , which is also hugely important to the European Parliament , and , of course , it calls for a new and stronger role for the European Parliament in relations with these countries .
That is precisely the reason for this own-initiative report .
We must demand reciprocity and access to foreign markets for our own products .
I would like to conclude by thanking Commissioner Špidla and wishing him every success .
( FR ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to congratulate all the rapporteurs , who have answered the big questions raised by the challenges of maritime safety and have faced up to our responsibilities .
However , the presidency-in-office has cooperated very closely with the permanent President in preparing the meeting of the European Commission , for example in the case of the General Affairs Council held on Monday during the Hungarian Presidency .
It is associated with a vast number of social ills that attract criminal activity .
When the European Parliament voted on the resolution setting priorities for the forthcoming summit between the EU and Canada , I was among the minority that voted against the proposal .
- Madam President , this is a dreadful piece of legislation .
Many sectors still remain closed , many practices in our Member States hinder the free flow of services , and the flagship idea of the Services Directive - the points of single contact - is not fully working .
We must also ensure that all young people have the right to undergo training .
The Commission has realised that the European Parliament now has a greater say in the Union &apos;s finances , and has decided , albeit later on , to respect this situation .
Urban areas generate around 80 % of GDP , consume up to 70 % of the energy in the EU and are the major centres of innovation , knowledge and culture .
A few years ago I myself had the opportunity to represent tens of thousands of European Union citizens when I presented a petition to the European Parliament and I am very pleased that at the time the European Parliament adopted a resolution based on the petition .
I hope that colleagues will join me in supporting the package today .
I therefore confirm my commitment to setting that deadline .
Finally , this response to the crisis must be such that the citizens understand it , so that it echoes the priorities of environment and energy , and says yes to an energy-independent European Union , but with all roads open , with all possibilities open , so that we can achieve precisely what we want .
It is a good thing that there is already a legal basis following the statement by the President of the Security Council , which has been welcomed by the Serbian Government .
Who is going to foot the bill for that ?
It is reported that there are 1 460 000 internally displaced people , most of them facing violence , and let me give a voice to those who do not have a voice , those who suffer such violence .
We need to make very clear what it is that we are talking about .
We also need to look to the future .
A European asylum policy is doomed to failure on account of the undesirable side effects of previous proposals : the Dublin Regulation was intended to prevent asylum tourism .
I voted for the report drafted by María Muñiz De Urquiza because the European Union &apos;s presence in multilateral organisations is one of the guiding principles of its foreign policy .
This will give people who have lost their jobs as a result of the crisis or who are finding it difficult to gain access to credit for their company the opportunity to undergo training , to retain existing jobs and , in some cases , even to create new ones .
First of all , my compliments to the rapporteur .
We must remember the track record of these institutions and their tragic consequences : Iraq , Afghanistan , the Balkans and Libya , and other countries that are also on the list .
( FR ) Mr President , I , in turn , would like to express my satisfaction with the agreement reached in conciliation .
The introduction of a uniform standard form for notification of instruments and decisions relating to the claim will resolve the problems of recognition and translation of instruments emanating from another Member State .
I am aware that it was no easy task to reach a compromise solution taking account of the interests of the national labour market whilst simultaneously protecting immigrants against exploitation .
It is , of course , first and foremost a question of the safety of those people who board an aeroplane .
There is also a rationale for such measures applying to the provision of health services , especially when new communication technologies allow controversial practices such as e-doctor consultations .
Therefore , I feel that patient safety is another area where the EU can provide real added value to make all European patients safer , while of course respecting Member States &apos; responsibility for delivering health care on their territories .
I also hope that there will be widespread approval here at this plenary session and that we will be able to see these 18 missing MEPs here in Parliament as soon as possible , and that this will be provided for by the Treaty of Lisbon .
In accordance with the treaty , the Commission must nevertheless remain neutral with regard to the public or private ownership of companies .
It is therefore important to get the Treaty in place and I can guarantee that we will do our utmost to ensure that this happens as soon as possible .
It is important to make clear our positive approach to Ukraine .
This report seems to have been written specially for Italy , where the RAI is now at an advanced stage of decomposition because it has been taken over completely by party politics , to the detriment of the cultural and informational depth of public broadcasting and , hence , of the entire country .
I had to explain that it was not a matter of either / or but that it was a matter of both .
In other words , a fisheries policy is not and cannot be a policy for the oceans or for the marine environment .
the statement by the Vice-President of the Commission and High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy on the situation in Syria and in Camp Ashraf and the situation of the Coptic Christian community of Egypt ,
This is of particular importance as the European elections approach , and I hope we can count on you to keep this matter high on the agenda .
Industrialised countries and emerging countries with more advanced economies should be subject to comparable efforts .
I think it is a big gap in the market .
The European Central Bank ( ECB ) has done what it needed to do in the face of a global financial crisis &apos; made in the USA &apos; .
The second point , which has just been mentioned , is the tax on financial transactions .
The Europe we must continue to build together is a strong Europe , an open Europe , a Europe of solidarity .
The second reason relates to substance .
Therefore , it is necessary to establish a common European Union system for the regulation of online gambling , taking into account the protection of risk groups , with particular attention to the protection of minors and control of transactions .
The conclusion of bilateral fisheries agreements between the European Community and non-member countries , termed &apos; Fisheries Partnership Agreements &apos; ( FPA ) since 2004 , has been standard practice under the common fisheries policy ( CFP ) and is central to the policy &apos;s external dimension .
Fourthly , I am grateful for the points that were made on what lessons we have learnt from Haiti .
In this way , we can also ensure that the same opportunities are pursued in these countries as elsewhere .
In the majority of Member States , health care , education , social services and the care of young people and the elderly are managed by the State .
I welcome the fact that we have actually signed interim agreements only with those countries that have shown an interest in signing such agreements .
The Commission is now looking at how to update and implement these instruments .
When this Presidency draws to a close , giving way to the Swedish Presidency , Europeans will express their views through the European elections , and I hope that the choices they make will help us to collectively take on the important commitments that await us .
We should also ensure that we do not have a myriad of labels on every product and it is time - and not only now , right before the European elections - to show the people at home and out and about that the European Union does work on worthwhile things that affect the citizens themselves and that very many of the nonsensical things that you can hear and read on a daily basis are not true .
At the same time , we are destroying the native land in which this massive destruction is taking place and , if we do not include the indicator in our legislation , this destruction will spread to other countries .
No deliveries of feed fat were made outside of Germany .
We should support more opposition in Iran .
The Commission would be in charge of drafting the rules regarding the modalities of the marking , and will pay the utmost attention to minimising costs by relying on international practices , consulting with Member States and all the industries and traders involved .
I would not dare to do so , but if we are leading by example , and , if we are putting down ideas between Parliament and the Commission about the ways we can see of regenerating new growth and about being innovative within the new economy , then the Member States must also step up to the plate and take those actions .
They are the ones sounding the alarm about the full landfills .
In the resolution , we congratulated Belarus , Ukraine and Lithuania , which became the first states to submit trilateral projects to the European Commission and EU Member States for the Eastern Partnership Programme .
I urge all my colleagues in this House to look at the solutions that have been highlighted by the E. G. West Centre at the University of Newcastle , which looks at private education for the poor .
I therefore agree with the need to ensure the parties fair and accurate information that allows them to be aware of their choices as soon as possible .
The request should have been made an hour before the sitting .
In summer 2007 , the same system was used to identify the financial activities of Germany-based members of the Islamic Jihad Union .
As part of the review of the Directive on integrated pollution prevention and control ( IPCC ) , the emphasis has been firmly placed on establishing limit values for certain combustion plants and on using the best available techniques ( BAT ) to ensure an adequate level of environmental protection .
I believe that the required degree of transparency is not present here .
You clearly do not believe the argument yourself that trade preferences can be used to promote prosperity and combat radicalism .
But this can only be decided at the national level because the support - apart from the European Investment Bank mentioned by Mr Verheugen - can only be provided by national taxpayers .
Often , when we talk about alternative energy sources , we talk ostentatiously about wind energy and solar energy , and of course we should do that .
Next week , we will be having discussions with the Foreign Minister , then we have the elections , then the EU-Ukraine Parliamentary Cooperation Committee , which is travelling to Ukraine , and it has always been the case - Mr Gahler , I am appealing to your sense of fairness here - that we say whether or not things went well after the elections , rather than pre-empting the elections by saying that things will not go well .
It is the norm in Parliament to hand out compliments and I am quite happy to do that but , with your permission President , I will reserve my praise for next time because I think that the Commission is quite late with its standardisation of electric vehicles .
There are several million undernourished children in Europe .
( ES ) Mr President , the historic and irreversible move towards democracy in the Arab countries did not end with the still-fragile transitions in Egypt and Tunisia , nor with the support , also historic , of the international community for the activation of the principle of responsibility to protect the Libyan population .
( EL ) Madam President , Baroness Ashton , I think that we are living in an absurd world and that you have been elected to play a role in it , in order to mitigate this irrationality absurdity .
However , this fight and this virtuous attitude absolutely must not be situated in a context of unfair competition .
On the question raised by Mr Belder , about the Commission position on granting visa-free access to Taiwanese visiting the EU : the Commission is considering , within the framework of the revision of the appropriate legislation , the possibility of updating the list of countries and entities which may not be subject to visa requirements in respect of visits to the European Union , especially the Schengen Area , and in this context it will also consider the case of Taiwan .
The Prime Minister has also made a strong and positive impact in showing how the United Kingdom can work effectively with its partners in the European Union , as together we find innovative solutions to the many challenges we face in common .
For instance , we could take France as an example , where any functional impairment is clearly indicated on the packet .
At least eight rounds of informal trialogues have been held to date , as well as three rounds of the negotiating process proper .
I must make it quite clear that we do not want a second European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights ( EIDHR ) , which is bureaucratic , slow , over-complex and unpolitical .
We must act to regulate profiling through legal parameters with the facility to guarantee the rights of any person , regardless of his or her race or religion .
Mr Tarabella states correctly that the principle of &apos; the same pay for the same work &apos; , valid in the treaties since 1957 , has not been complied with and women in some Member States are still not paid the same rate for the same work as men .
And when , after much forbearance , Israel hits back , they cry victim .
Last Sunday , Mr Schäuble said that , in this context , he was in favour of a European Monetary Fund and also of other proposals and options , such as the creation of a European debt agency , Eurobonds and even a European rating agency .
Do you think that it would also be possible to use Erasmus programmes in order to improve communication in border regions , and where would you put the emphasis in that regard ?
President-in-Office of the Council . - Mr President , Ms Grossetête , distinguished Members , let me continue in my mother tongue , Hungarian .
Some 1 000 Irish families host Belarusian children in their homes every summer and at Christmas , which often includes medical assessment and in some cases treatment .
A G20 development agenda must be adopted , with a multiannual action plan , which will promote economic growth and flexibility for developing countries .
Firstly , we are calling for legally binding and equally ambitious commitments , not just for the other industrialised countries , but also for the emerging economies and , in particular , China , India and Brazil .
I am very pleased that he is supporting the proposal negotiated by the committee , because it really is a very good compromise between various standpoints : a compromise between the Commission &apos;s standpoint , on the one hand , and the opinions presented by the Member States , and , on the other , it is compatible with investors &apos; interests , but most of all , it opens up good prospects for the Union &apos;s investment policy in the future , serving the Union as a whole .
The States will have to commit themselves in Copenhagen !
We respect the decision of the Member States to enter into the European Pact for Mental Health and Well-being referred to in the report .
Above all it will make the market safer and more competitive .
In this respect , standardisation of electric vehicles becomes vital .
Mr President , taxation is absolutely vital for the running of countries - I think most citizens would agree with that .
It also equally concerns profits made directly from crime as well as profits arising indirectly from crime at a later time .
I support Mrs Hennis-Plasschaert &apos;s report on the next steps in border management in the European Union .
The scale of the disaster is unprecedented in Pakistan &apos;s history .
in writing . - Nobody disputes that Ukraine is our &apos; strategic partner &apos; whose situation is of great interest to us .
Mr President , I was glad in the Parish report on animal testing that Amendment 170 passed .
They will develop their reactors , which is why we must ensure that Europe &apos;s high standards are imposed not only in Europe , but also in the rest of the world , especially in our neighbouring states , Russia and Belarus .
( PL ) Mr President , Mr Kallas , one doubt I have is related to the fact that some countries in Europe , for example , the United Kingdom , use a different time in relation to continental Europe , and this lack of change does not cause problems there .
This will simplify matters greatly , and I hope that a single regulation on aquaculture will make the procedures as a whole even simpler .
In addition to drawing up such a Green Paper , does the Commission consider it important to build synergies between other international organisations such as the ILO and the UN in relation to the JHU / ILO Volunteer Measurement Project and the UN Non-Profit Handbook ?
I am therefore grateful to you , Commissioner , for this proposal , and I hope that you will show just as much determination in actually implementing the plan , once it has been ratified by the Council , as you showed in reaching a satisfactory agreement within the ICCAT .
In my opinion , the time has come to find out who is responsible for this delay , make an in-depth assessment of the situation and find solutions that will make this project technically viable and restore its already weakened credibility .
For this reason , I ask all Members to support Amendment 16 and to sign Written Declaration 96 - to which I am a signatory , together with Cornelia Ernst , Sylvie Guillaume and Franziska Keller - in order to petition Member States to ratify the UN Convention on migrant workers .
You cannot force scientists to produce findings within a particular timeframe .
When , for example , a constitutional court has no jurisdiction in budgetary and taxation matters , this constitutes a restriction in the separation of powers and is unquestionably a dubious situation .
( Parliament rejected the motion )
We continue to cooperate in this difficult field , but I think that with these two big agreements , the landscape has changed a little and we notice modest progress .
Mr President , I therefore believe that the time has come to join forces , for us to realise that the world is not waiting for us , the Europeans , and that either we Europeans must unite and maintain constructive positions regarding the problems that our citizens are experiencing at the moment , or else Europe , as a power , will disappear from the map .
I agree that it is necessary to take preventative measures in all EU bilateral trade agreements , including human rights clauses , and the application of appropriate sanctions should be considered for countries that fail to comply with such clauses .
I would first of all like to thank the rapporteur , Mrs Estrela , for her report and the effort she has put into this .
Several options for a long-term solution are being considered , with the United Nations in the lead , all of them with challenges .
( DE ) Madam President , long-term food security is one of the central challenges of the common agricultural policy .
It is therefore clear that an intensive effort to construct nuclear power stations will be necessitated in the very near future .
However , the European energy policy cannot be effectively promoted without having adequate and clear information about existing and planned energy infrastructure and projects in the European Union .
The exemptions for EURO V and EURO VI are also positive , as well as the fact that the Member States have again committed to regulating the interoperability of toll systems , as it is a thorn in our sides that that is still not the case .
Profiling and good intelligence exchange are also very much required .
The next Commission will therefore be called on to continue this work .
For our group , the partnership between the European Union and the ACP countries is part of an historic commitment , which must retain all its specific characteristics , which must not be watered down , even by the need to comply with certain rules , such as those of the WTO .
I voted in favour of the financial measures because it was necessary to amend the regulation in order to adapt it to current demands and to the functioning of the Union .
We will need all our available strength at political level simply to hold Member States to respecting their 2005 commitments .
I think that we will soon see a period in which pluralism can be better ensured , but in any case , I would not want to question the honesty of the work by those people who have taken up their task conscientiously , and one person in particular , Mr Lacoste .
We note with great concern that , according to estimates , developing countries are expected to face a financial shortfall in 2010 of more than USD 300 billion and that mounting budgetary problems in the most vulnerable countries are jeopardising the operation and development of core areas such as education , health , infrastructure and social protection , with a value in excess of USD 11.5 billion .
EUR 6 billion has been provided for wind farm developments across the EU , according to Mr Maystadt , but the EIB simply accepts the applications for funding from the governments concerned without scrutiny .
I realise that it is difficult and I realise that the rules can be very complicated .
This is not a case of the Council granting a favour but of observing the terms of the treaty .
Vice President of the United States of America . - Mr President , thank you for that welcome .
I can only support access to healthcare for all EU citizens irrespective of the State in which they reside .
The motion for a resolution - and I pay tribute for this to our rapporteur - is a well-balanced one , especially since we have taken into account the interests of our partners from the ACP countries , as well as local European banana producers .
When we are talking about affordable prices for the poor , often unemployed , consumer , food should be accessible at significantly lower prices , or simply supplied without charge , of course under special programmes and under specific conditions .
Of course , if we go with such a proposal , we must negotiate with our social partners , the trade unions .
The Chinese authorities say that the Dalai Lama is a private person .
Con questo si conclude il turno di votazioni .
The data that is obtained can , and should , contribute to policy evaluation , enabling assessment of the environmental impact of economic activities .
In addition to the usual legislative work , the Swedish Presidency will have other kinds of highly political challenges to deal with , and no one better to tackle these challenges than Prime Minister Reinfeldt and the Swedish Presidency team .
However , the honourable Members will surely agree with me in saying that this agreement is a lot better than the protocol over data exchange that the United States and the EU have had to comply with for years .
The Commission has major tasks ahead of it when it comes to restructuring the East-West connection , for example , from Paris to Budapest , or the North-South connection .
For some months now , Côte d &apos;Ivoire has been the scene of urban guerrilla warfare between the supporters of the outgoing President and the people .
It was no easy task that you had and you have included something of what Professor Monti set out in his report and what Mr Grech drew up for the European Parliament .
( RO ) Mr President , I welcome the civil movements in Tunisia and Egypt that have successfully toppled two dictatorial regimes which had become entrenched over several decades .
I voted in favour of this report because I share the rapporteur &apos;s views concerning the focal points of the common agricultural policy reform for the period after April 2013 .
We have also funded a number of new studies with a view to ensuring that alcohol remains high on the EU &apos;s agenda .
Therefore , at a time when changes to the appendices of the CITES are being discussed , I recognise the importance of also ensuring that there is sufficient protection for endangered wild species without jeopardising or consigning to oblivion any activities that ensure the economic and social viability of many communities .
The numbers are frightening : it is true , as Mr Albertini said , there is no final count as yet , but we can nonetheless say that there have been around 300 deaths .
Election results in these countries provide clear evidence .
As I said , I would also like to thank my fellow Members , and Mrs Ferreira in particular .
Therefore , to convince our partners in development to join us , we must obviously address the question of the aid they should be given and not wait for the results of the Copenhagen Summit .
The infrastructure managers are to a large extent responsible for this difficulty , and so we need to encourage them to work together , whether in terms of infrastructure management or planning and carrying out investment .
We also need a migration policy for economic reasons , because demographic changes are taking place and we have a very urgent need not just for highly qualified workers , but also for less skilled workers .
As we have already discussed , we must also be careful not to place responsibility with the wrong people or institutions in maritime transport .
( NL ) Mr President , when dossiers are cooked up behind closed doors , alarm bells start ringing in my group .
( ES ) Mr President , I would like to congratulate Mr Jáuregui on the very serious work that he has done .
Finally , not much has been said about e-health , but that is a very important resource as well , and we will hear more on the topic in future .
I believe that , with clearly defined indicators , the work can be carried out in the best possible way .
The issues raised in this discussion are extremely important .
Whilst this is not , in my opinion , a deeply significant issue in my own Member State - as we do not intend to join the euro and resulting fines do not apply to us - it is an extremely difficult and contentious issue in many countries , including those who intend to join .
In plain language , that means that you want to force those who are sick to ask for permission before they go to the doctor , at least if they do so in another EU Member State .
The Commission will obviously continue to monitor developments in the market and will use the means at its disposal to intervene in the market if this proves necessary and useful .
In addition to the short-term measures , long-term efforts are needed if we are to ensure the competitiveness of our economies .
It is up to Iceland to clearly subscribe to a genuine project of integration with the rest of Europe .
The world is staking its future on the months to come .
I hope that you will agree , Commissioner , that in the context of helping more women into the labour market , and in the context of helping people with the important role of childcare , that there are indeed many roads to Paradise - and there is not just the one road that we should exclusively concentrate upon .
Once again , the Spanish Presidency of the EU has come at a crucial time .
Equally disturbing is the advancing reduction in the level of the EU budget in relation to the GNI of EU Member States .
All these aspects are necessary in a genuine European asylum policy , which we have long been calling for and which must be based on the principles of coherence , responsibility , solidarity and respect for human rights .
We moved in when it was dry , but now the rain has come and is falling on the euro area in the form of a high deficit and debt level , with low creditworthiness .
She got through secondary school fine , so it was no problem there , but now she has been sidelined .
Of course , we know that some wrong turns were taken and we have rectified these to some extent .
And voters would surely count that against us come the next gas crisis .
I would like to thank all three rapporteurs and the many shadow rapporteurs and fellow Members who have produced this joint work .
The foundation has been laid for creating a common European energy market , based on rules set out in detail in the binding network codes .
That is what I wished to say .
This is a start .
Aid that leads to a distortion of competition undermines the future of the European car industry and will have negative consequences for both employment and technical development .
The first is the question of the regulations governing product claims .
If we bear in mind that shipping services are provided not only by colossal undertakings but also , particularly in the case of ferry operators , by small and medium-sized enterprises , we must take a reasonable approach to compensation .
Another increasingly important aspect is the development of transport along inland waterways and the European maritime corridors .
This is my valedictory speech to the European Parliament , since I was first elected a quarter of a century ago and my father was elected 30 years ago - Peter Beazley , a Member of the European Parliament for Bedfordshire and North Hertfordshire .
( DE ) Mr President , Mrs Schauvliege , Commissioner , I am concerned that we are going from one extreme to the other .
I feel that it is necessary to consolidate this scheme by expanding the number of organisations which apply it and to recognise it as a benchmark eco-management scheme .
At a time when the impact of the recession and public debt crisis is being strongly felt , we need robust economic governance at EU level .
We also need to look closely at the social situation , which plays a major role in disadvantaged regions .
According to the spokesman , the matter concerned several thousand people , but he was not able to give their precise number .
That makes it even more urgent to be true and bold , transparent and to have courage .
( The sitting was suspended at 13 : 15 and resumed at 15 : 00 )
Nevertheless , the interim measures are adequate in order to effect important alterations as soon as possible .
In addition - and this fear has also been expressed by other MEPs in this House - the anticipated simplification would be replaced by other administrative burdens such as requests for information by tax administrations , potential credit providers and even trade unions ; all seeking transparency .
This proves why we definitely need some measure to introduce a level playing field as is contained in Mr Romeva i Rueda &apos;s report , because a similar offence in some parts of the EU would probably merit a fine of just EUR 2 000 or EUR 3 000 .
If this report were applied literally , it would prohibit an opera company from declining to hire men in soprano roles , it would prohibit a Labour politician from declining to have a Conservative as their press spokesman , and it would prohibit a Catholic school or hospital from preferring to employ its own co-religionists .
The Commission has also set up a consumer market scoreboard that permits monitoring of market outcomes for consumers .
In accordance with the principle of subsidiarity , it seems logical to me that , when identifying intermediate LFAs , the Member States be allowed to take into account not only biophysical criteria but also others , such as being an island or an outermost region .
Nevertheless , we are confident about our mature human rights dialogue and cooperation with Vietnam .
This Parliament has made an important contribution to the creation of the new European Financial Supervisory Authorities .
It is also very regrettable that the review of the current financial perspective is only ready today , much too late to introduce that flexibility .
I believe that , of the three requirements relating to CO2 , renewable energy and energy efficiency , the 20 % increase in energy efficiency presents us with the most difficult and complex challenge .
Under the supervision of the Chair , Mr Harbour , who heard me say this in the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection , and in response to Mr Triantaphyllides &apos;s speech , I would like to remind you of the principle behind the action I will be taking within the Commission over the next five years .
As a guarantor of respect for human rights , the EU must get involved and take prompt action diplomatically so that the Zapata tragedy will never be repeated in Cuba , or anywhere else in the world for that matter .
We must make public opinion understand that in a modern , democratic society , there is no place for violence against women .
Certainly we do not want - I think it is in nobody &apos;s interests - to have a Commission that is without full legal competences .
We all know that when , many years ago , the Japanese state set high environmental targets , the Japanese economy actually strengthened its competitiveness , for the first time .
Egypt is at the centre of the peace talks that are discussing an extended ceasefire with Hamas .
Every year , when it comes to discharging this budgetary warship of the Council , it suddenly disappears into the Bermuda triangle and the European Parliament seems happy to apply the motto &apos; everything that is not on our radar screen does not exist in reality , either &apos; .
We therefore need to oppose this new secular religion and madness , which is placing a question mark over whether there was any sense at all in countries such as Poland joining the European Union , since it would be forced to spend much more money on reducing CO2 emissions than its net gains from cohesion policy to date .
The European social partners are also due to submit a joint contribution on how to overcome the crisis at the tripartite meeting on 19 March .
We discussed the same problem last year in Angers during the French Presidency and , again , the health ministers insisted that each Member State should be free to decide for itself how many stocks it wanted .
As I mentioned earlier , the Commission proposals are now being studied in much more detail .
The increase in the budget deficit and public debt in Greece over the last two or three years was the result of the collapse in incomes , the reduction in income from abroad , such as tourism and shipping , due to the crisis , and the increase in public spending .
Fossil fuels create pollution that endangers both human health and a healthy environment , and they are expensive and their prices increase the more we run out of oil and gas .
There must be discussion of the results in April at the Second European Roma Summit in Córdoba .
There is no stability without solidarity .
It also presented three draft negotiating mandates for the conclusion of agreements with Canada , the United States and Australia , all three with identical content .
Under the current circumstances , the election of a new president at the elections scheduled for 29 November would be devoid of legitimacy from the outset , and its results cannot and should not be recognised by the international community .
Full funding is required from the EU budget for food aid programmes as some Member States will be unable to participate in the scheme when cofinancing rates apply .
I believe there is an urgent need to create a common set of standards for the verification of biometric data .
Then , we always vote in favour of what we consider to be an improvement and against what we consider to be a change for the worse .
And that is exactly what the Goldstone report has done - although it was not just Mr Goldstone , it was also his two female colleagues .
Madam President , Commissioner , the first thing that I wish to say is that all the socialist delegates subscribe to the words uttered by Pervenche Berès , Chair of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs , and we are very pleased about the position just taken by the Commissioner on this initiative of the International Labour Organisation ( ILO ) .
Also crucial is the recommendation for Member States to increase the staffing of SOLVIT centres in order to build up administrative capacity in the various ministries at national level .
Consequently , it would be advisable to maintain the principles of cohesion policy and the accompanying financial resources beyond 2013 .
Dink &apos;s death was , of course , a great tragedy , and as a friend of Turkey , I did not hesitate to point out the damage to Turkey &apos;s standing of restricting freedom of expression and being oversensitive about criticisms of the Turkish State .
I and my group will support the compromise reached by rapporteur Karas with great skill and patience under heavy time pressure and in the current feverish economic circumstances .
Currently , the Commission is in the process of preparing such a report for Cyprus .
( EL ) Mr President , the skill of the captain shows in the storm .
It took us the best part of the last 10 years to deliver this treaty but only the last 10 months to realise how important it is .
The residual mechanism and the International Criminal Court can take over , but good and less good experiences should never be lost , in my view .
President Barroso came here not long ago to give a State of the Union address , and I think we should remind him of this , clearly stating the Union &apos;s strategy with regard to the financial market .
Although growth in the European Union is still suffering the consequences of the 2008 economic crisis , I voted in favour of Mr Gauzès &apos; report because it helps rationalise the financial system through better control of investment funds .
( PL ) Every revolution entails the risk that the demands of the people for democracy and bread will be appropriated by enemies of a rule of law based on lawful and real democratic foundations .
Therefore , I can only say - together with the other Co-Chairs and also particularly with Norway - that we have used every opportunity to press the parties in conflict to implement the 2002 ceasefire agreement and to solve the conflict using peaceful means , but nothing has worked .
This is why I believe that this is such an important subject .
I am very confident , Madam President , that after this well-rounded debate , Parliament will assent to the Stabilisation and Association Agreement .
It was not invented by nutritionists , but is the product of many centuries of tradition , passed down through generations .
The next item is the debate on the report by Mrs Neyts-Uyttebroeck , on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs , on a proposal for a European Parliament recommendation to the Council on the mandate of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia .
I have four observations on this matter .
At the same time , our cooperation with Russia in the Security Council on the issue of Libya or on Iran &apos;s nuclear programme is pleasing .
Allow me to reiterate and highlight the main points of my report .
Christians are still persecuted in Turkey and it remains one of our biggest concerns .
It is vital that we bequeath a healthy environment to future generations .
Mr President , I make no secret of the fact that the provisions set out in the Banana Accompanying Measures are a gamble on the future , for various reasons .
Since fishermen &apos;s work must be regulated internationally , the legislator is , of course , the International Labour Organization ( ILO ) and we are currently celebrating the 50th anniversary of the first ILO fishing conventions , on the minimum age , employment controls , medical examinations and accommodation .
It was a notion based on moralistic preaching rather than on scientific evidence by the WHO and , thankfully , it was rejected by the Commission .
Go to Tehran , go to Tehran , cowards , cowards , cowards , cowards !
The aim , after all , should be to achieve a peaceful solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and the future prosperity of two independent states , Israel and Palestine , and not a power struggle between Europe and the US for influence in this region .
Parliament wanted to make the citizens &apos; initiative as userfriendly as possible , and it has mainly succeeded in this .
( FR ) Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , several points have been raised , but the use of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund inspires two feelings in me .
I will end with a final word on the serious cases of Palestine and the Western Sahara , where women and children are the main victims of war and exploitation , in short the whole process of discrimination that affects these people and which seriously affects women and children .
Whilst Mr Sterckx obliges ports not to turn ships away , Mr Savary says that they can deny entry if insurance certificates are not being provided .
I know many colleagues in this House have met him personally and his determination to work for minority communities in Pakistan , to hold up their rights , is an example to us all .
Nonetheless , I am disappointed that certain countries such as Denmark and the United Kingdom are not taking part in these coordination schemes for non-EU nationals .
The European Union , as a trade partner and important negotiating partner at global level , should help promote higher labour and social standards in third countries .
( PL ) Mr President , it is not only Egypt , and it is not only Malaysia , but also Sudan , Nigeria and many other countries in Africa , many countries in Asia and many societies which treat Christians as a necessary evil , and sometimes as an enemy .
The specific consequences for small and medium-sized enterprises should be taken into account where appropriate and they must always be kept up to date with current developments in the legislative process .
In the next framework programme , this situation must change so that we will be able to fulfil the aims of the reformed common fisheries policy .
We are preparing to adopt a measure that should protect the consumer , informing him or her of the origin of products for a more general purpose , which renews equality of opportunity in international trade and reciprocity between the European Union and its main competitors .
Until now , Europe has avoided conflicts with the countries concerned and has made political concessions and gestures .
It is also essential for fishing companies to be encouraged through legislation to use the best equipment currently available in terms of selectivity , and thereby to avoid catching such huge quantities of under-sized fish and fish other than the target species , or by-catches .
It is , of course , right that cohesion policy has to play a part in assuaging the consequences of this economic crisis .
We also need to bear in mind that the EU will have to face , from time to time , animal-health or food-safety problems , and we insist that third countries react in a proportionate manner to these problems .
I wish Croatia , Macedonia and Turkey every success on their European journey .
I want to reassure you on that point .
They land in Lampedusa and a few in Malta , and we are the only ones taking them in .
I appeal to the need to develop mechanisms of financing and governing with practical effects for the accomplishment of this strategy .
Like the resolution resulting from the Mitchell report voted on today , the present resolution also accepts the need to perform a mainly technical clarification in the same vein in an attempt to guarantee the position of the European Parliament in the legislative process and in the control and monitoring of the acts of the Commission .
Clearly , the introduction of such significant changes cannot be perceived solely as a temporary measure .
The Commission must acknowledge that all arguments point to the fact that EU-wide measures and instruments have to be introduced .
Only dialogue , the mechanisms of cooperation and compromise through an international treaty will enable the European Union to demand anything from Cuba , and those who refuse dialogue are obstructing the search for a dignified way out for those that they claim to be defending .
It is important to avoid the commercialisation of organ donation and to guarantee that the donation of organs from live donors is completely free , while obviously ensuring the provision of all the necessary care and compensation for loss of earnings .
This resolution expresses grave concern at the tragic , violent clashes which broke out in southern Kyrgyzstan recently and extends its condolences to the families of all the victims .
Europe will have the will and the ability to be united , for only union will afford us the chance to fulfil our tasks .
Colleagues , we expected something quite different .
Of course , Lithuania , like other EU Member States , must devote somewhat more attention to the problem of under-age smoking .
I would like to emphasise that the income side of the European Union budget should be stable and predictable .
I am therefore voting in favour of the measures proposed in this report .
In fact , by choosing Mr Maroni , the government made a decision not to allow any more migrants to leave Lampedusa .
Together , we are coming an important step closer to a legal framework which will allow Member States to collaborate on the construction of new large research infrastructures , which are becoming increasingly complex and expensive , and which can only be built if several European countries work together .
We in the Group of the Greens / European Free Alliance are very proud of our achievement in having this fixed in the resolution , even if only cautiously .
My thanks to the High Representative , to Commissioners Piebalgs and Georgieva , and to their Directorates-General , who deserve our gratitude .
I have received one motion for a resolution at the end of the debate .
With regard to the report on transitional technical measures , I would like to highlight - which was also done during a number of speeches - the amendment supported by myself and two other Members , seeking to eliminate negative discrimination with no scientific basis , and I emphasise that there is no scientific basis justifying the negative discrimination against some segments of the Portuguese small-scale fleet that use trammel nets .
We need a fairer CAP with a large enough budget for what is asked of it .
In this connection , I believe that perhaps we could learn a little from the fact that it could perhaps be advantageous to hold back a little on demands for a Tobin tax and other taxes , because this is part of the cause of the divisions in Parliament .
Regarding the task force , I agree with those who say that it must be ambitious .
I found many very strong arguments in favour of the Gallagher amendments but , in the end , voted with my group to maintain political cohesion within the group .
However , I must raise some reservations and objections concerning the reduction of targets .
This measure fails to take the slightest account of food security and the precautionary principle .
However , the stability of Central Asia is in the interests of the region itself , in our interests , and in the strategic interests of the world as a whole .
Millions of European citizens &apos; telephone bills could go down , or , on the other hand , just the opposite may happen : given that a text message would only cost 11 cents , people could be texting all day long and end up spending the same amount .
It is very important for our citizens to have the opportunity to obtain necessary and high quality healthcare services whether they are at home or abroad .
There are 35 European regions which are in a similar situation .
I think there is a striking lack of male speakers and I am glad that my group has been able to send two .
I reject such a trivial generalisation of a problem which is affecting western countries in exactly same way .
The Greens believe the final compromise allows Member States to establish a reasonable system of prior authorisation for the reimbursement of treatment costs , with MEPs succeeding in limiting the list of reasons for which a patient can be refused cross-border treatment .
Use the military and the police - not to suppress the people , not to keep local authorities out - but to get hold of the real culprits .
We are looking at the law in this respect , as raised by Mr Tavares and others .
Questions 8 and 9 have been withdrawn .
As has been said repeatedly , Commissioner , the problem of social housing and of access to housing is a major problem today , at this time of crisis .
Mr President , Commissioner , first I wish to thank the rapporteurs for their excellent work .
This Commission report on the protection of the Communities &apos; financial interests - Fight against fraud - Annual Report 2009 , submitted in line with Article 325 ( 2 ) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union ( TFEU ) , does not , in general , provide any information about the estimated level of irregularity and fraud in each Member State , but rather focuses on the level of communication .
in writing . - After a thorough scrutiny together with several NGOs , we have decided to support the signature of the two VPAs .
Both parties welcomed our mission and expressed their readiness to engage in mutual dialogue .
In the context of work connected with Parliament &apos;s Committee on Women &apos;s Rights and Gender Equality , the report by the socialist Member , Mrs Britta Thomsen , is meant to be generous in terms of social progress .
It is a very pessimistic conclusion , but I close with this thought : in spite of everything , we should not cease in our efforts , and should be consistent in exerting pressure .
We cannot carry on saying &apos; yes &apos; to everything that is tabled in order to demonstrate our justified concern , uncertainty and willingness to act with regard to the issue of climate change .
We need to strike a balance between the two and not allow one interest to prevail over the other .
In this debate , we have heard a number of specific pointers , which we shall obviously not fail to pass on .
Let me give you a little more detail on our positions .
( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , we have seen that no country can face the problem of immigration alone .
Although prevention is better than cure , we will also be better placed to take action to correct these situations if they do emerge .
Personally , at any rate , I would very much like to see that happen .
We have an institutional setting that we have to respect and we had to take a position : &apos; yes &apos; or &apos; no &apos; .
in writing . - I support this report on the EU &apos;s accession to the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms ( ECHR ) , as provided by the Lisbon Treaty .
In particular , we want to strengthen its producer and inter-branch organisations so as to better link production forecasts to market needs and ensure higher value for their products through marketing and labelling .
In addition , some provisions , particularly the recommendations on the reuse of animals and on the proposed use of only F2 primates ( second-generation primates ) are likely to mean that many more animals will have to be used .
They are outside the European Union , but they live well all the same ; they have the same problems , but they are no worse off than us , and here it is important to see and to demonstrate that it is worth having the European Union .
I therefore expressly welcome the Commission &apos;s proposal to employ effective controls in the context of raw materials management .
A Single Market which works well is essential for ensuring competitiveness , the creation of jobs and sustainable growth in Europe .
The Euro Plus Pact adopted by the Heads of State or Government , with the involvement of the countries in the euro area and Bulgaria , Denmark , Lithuania , Latvia , Poland and Romania , provides us with a real chance of achieving the objectives set out in it , or in other words supporting competitiveness , employment , the stability of public finances and financial stability in general .
We all want an Internet that is open .
- ( CS ) Mr President , I also voted against the adoption of this report from a Communist MEP on the situation of fundamental rights in the European Union .
There are many areas in which women &apos;s circumstances could be improved , including ensuring adequate social cover .
Mr President , Mr Barroso , ladies and gentlemen , you represent the continuity of a policy , Mr Barroso , which has contributed to the greatest economic crisis in post-war history .
Yet let us choose the right ones , for example , the procurement rules that are unnecessarily imperative and complex .
( HU ) Mr President , We have a technical problem .
I would only note that the President of the Commission has stated very clearly here that he , too , vouches for the letter sent by Commissioner Kroes , and that it also has the approval of the Commission as a whole .
However , there is also a second dimension to this issue .
Such investments are offset due to savings at the appeal stages and a reduction in overall reception costs .
Now more urgently , I say to you today , and most of all to the President of the Commission , who has the executive power : you shall not crucify the taxpayers of the UK and the rest of Europe on the cross of the single currency .
However , the EU should not be under any illusions that granting trade preferences could put an end to the advance of fundamental Islamists and terrorists in the nuclear state of Pakistan .
I would like to thank the President for his generosity and to give you all my best wishes for this festive season and for the coming year .
( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I should just like to point out that I consider to be totally unfounded the interpretation of our Rules of Procedure as suggested by Mr Cohn-Bendit , who refers to private and personal interests , which clearly have nothing to do with the application of the rules of this Parliament .
We have removed all these obligations , all these requests from the report as it had been adopted by the Committee on Women &apos;s Rights and Gender Equality .
Some of them are , but there are quite a few you propose to take off the menu that are not dangerous .
Will the Commissioner rename the sixth European industrial initiative simply the &apos; nuclear energy initiative &apos; ?
The interest earned by the Commission on deposits lodged in accordance with Article 4 and the fines collected in accordance with Article 5 and 6a should constitute other revenue referred to in Article 311 of the Treaty , and will be allocated to the European Financial Stability Facility .
I am pleased that the Commission has now put forward a proposal .
Unfortunately , the Commission had no other option but to withhold EU structural funds intended for Campania , funds which will only be released once the waste management plan for Campania becomes compliant and consistent with EU law .
Even today , therefore , there is a certain aloofness in the position of the Chinese administration , and an effort to suppress any manifestation of the cultural traditions and identity that are linked to the rich cultural monuments of the Uyghurs and the city of Kashgar .
Reform is not enough - it is time to scrap the CAP .
When addressing waste management problems in the European Union , I therefore call on the Commission to draw attention to such violations where waste management priorities laid down in the European Union directive on waste are not followed and there is encouragement not to follow them .
I have the impression that the opinions of European citizens are increasingly diverging from those of the political elite .
What is so difficult about saying that the same should be the case for people in the Middle East ?
The Commission has been asked to carry out some preparatory work based on these action plans , which were developed within the framework of the European Neighbourhood Policy .
The first - and the primary - objective of our strategy has been to prevent another cardiac arrest of the kind that followed the failure of Lehman Brothers in September 2008 and subsequently led to the financial crisis and economic recession worldwide .
That is the purpose behind this crucial draft directive to promote measures aimed at removing the barriers to broader and better coordinated ITS deployment .
in writing . - ( ES ) I have voted in favour of this agreement because it fulfils the objective of maintaining the activities of the EU fishing fleet in collaboration with third countries with the aim of strengthening sustainable fishing whilst respecting the environment and social and economic aspects .
However , the solution is not to indulge the production companies more , but to really shift benefits from them to artists and performers .
The purpose of this text is to amend Directive 2009 / 42 / EC to make the collection of data by type of goods mandatory for maritime transport statistics .
I voted in favour of the European Parliament resolution of 18 February 2009 on humanitarian aid to the Gaza Strip , as the civilian population is in great need of aid because of the situation created in this area .
The European Parliament , which is so sensitive to violations of human rights and the rights of minorities , must make a statement on this matter .
We honour the victims of those murders .
The medicines which are being faked have already been approved , which means that any issues of intellectual property have been resolved .
My final point is that I inherited the Nuclear Safety Directive of June 2009 , which must be transposed into national law by July of this year .
It is a crucial first step towards more participation , more democracy and finally , more Europe .
To say , however , we have congestion , so the goods vehicles must pay for it , gives the Member States no incentive to remove the congestion , as to do so would cost them revenue .
Take a look at Asia , Commissioner .
It is my intention that , before the end of this year , our regionalised office there should become a fully-fledged delegation to encourage the reform process and facilitate full implementation of the PCA .
Our vote against is due to the application of the principle of free movement to health services , without taking account of their specificities , including the need for a public national health service whose primary purpose in each country is to respond to the needs of its citizens .
Men were repressed , women were disembowelled with bayonets , and raped , and the political opponents and trade unionists were tortured and maimed .
Mr President , Mr Špidla , ladies and gentlemen , on 22 December 2008 , the President of the Republic of Guinea , Lanzana Conté , died at the age of 74 .
We support anything that improves and expands the internal market .
This means that the cause of the poverty is politics , and not vice versa .
If Spanish students receive a grant to study in Latin America for a few months , or vice versa , then such an exchange is useful , necessary and desirable , but a project such as this cannot be exclusively financed with funds that are intended to fight poverty .
As Europe changes , the position of individual states and groups changes in respect of this policy .
After this beginning , I believe that all the issues which you , too , have raised in the debate will be discussed .
I also welcome the retention of the systems of registering geographical indications and traditional specialities , as these indications are significant for European agriculture not only from an economic perspective , but also from an environmental and social perspective .
We must not forget that there are 7 million unemployed in Europe today , 3 million of whom are 19 to 24 years old .
However , the Swedish Prime Minister , who is presiding over the Council , and the Danish Prime Minister , who is hosting the Copenhagen Summit , are , unfortunately , among these pessimists .
in writing . - &apos; Every person shall have the right to life .
I also would like to recognise the decisive and effective actions of the Hungarian authorities to contain the impact of the spill and its spread from the rivers Torna and Marcal downstream into the Danube and into neighbouring countries , and also to prevent the risks of new spills by building additional protection walls .
It adds that the Member States must ensure that their budgetary plan is founded on realistic macroeconomic and budgetary forecasts .
I voted in favour of the motion for a resolution from the Group of the European People &apos;s Party ( Christian Democrats ) / European Conservatives and Reformists and against the others because the international ACTA makes it possible to combat counterfeiting more effectively , which will lead to better copyright protection and , by extension , help protect European industry .
I hope and I trust - and you will have the support of this Chamber in continuing to do so - that you continue to set an example to many other countries which are very behind in this respect .
Today it is hard to imagine what our region would be like without EU support .
There is always an agenda between two partners that are so important and which are immersed in a global economic crisis , and when there are challenges such as terrorism , climate change , energy security or nuclear proliferation .
( PT ) Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , a consistent approach to the problem of climate change , which goes beyond simply setting emission reduction targets , requires a realistic explanation of the means by which they can be achieved .
It is undoubtedly true that weak national economies must be subjected to strict controls on their budgets and their debt management strategy if they want to remain in the euro area .
A European system of measuring quality is a good idea .
Others gave background support .
Regarding freedom of speech , the Commission will continue to promote this fundamental right in international forums .
I should also like to thank the rapporteur , Mrs Stihler , who worked exhaustively on this proposal and , thanks to her commitment , has enabled us to reach an agreement at second reading .
Among other things , it requires effective antitrust legislation .
The measures which have been announced concerning the strengthening of consular protection in third countries should be implemented as soon as possible , and negotiations with third countries on the lifting of visa requirements should be continued .
In the area of innovation and regional policy , a total of EUR 86 billion has already been earmarked for this financial period , and this is intended to help small and medium-sized enterprises in particular , to improve the quality of their workforce , their production methods and the services that they are able to offer .
Another issue that it would be important to consider is the possibility of aid to stimulate an inter-island market for the sale of local agricultural products .
They risk being forgotten and that is something we have to be very much aware of .
This is the only path open to us to restore hope to young people , to motivate them to take over family farms , to convince them that agriculture is , quite simply , a sector with a future .

Vice-President of the Commission . - The plan is to deploy the ERTMS system on main European railway networks before 2015 , so there is a date where we think that this deployment plan will be implemented , but this does not mean that every line , especially regional lines , will be equipped with such high-level equipment , so there must always be other systems as well .
I am encouraged by the Serbian Government &apos;s adoption on 30 December of an action plan as a follow-up to the Commission &apos;s progress report .

The Communication highlights existing best practice developed by the Member States to address the main problems linked to the operating cost and telecom cost of the 116 000 hotline .
My colleague , Mr Arif , will not mind , I think , if I say that to suggest that I would sacrifice any industry , I find alarming or perhaps a little depressing , because that is certainly not the approach that I would take .
In connection with this , financing instruments should be designed in such a way as to ensure long-term economic growth in developing countries .
I would therefore stress a basic political point , namely that we have almost achieved unanimity so that the future financial framework tallies with the political mandate of the future Parliament , and that is an arrangement that we would like to see perpetuated .

This report is the result of the collaboration and excellent cooperation I had .
Given the 15-minute presentation we heard from the Commissioner earlier on , would you accept that that is just clearly not the case ; that your sort of hyperbole undermines the case in the serious discussion we are having here tonight about a very technical piece of legislation and regulation ; and that you are not actually helping the case , you are hindering it ?
There is abuse that has nothing to do with the written law but rather relates to the implementation of the law , and that is a problem that has a solution .
Secondly , as regards fairness , why is a Swedish car worker supported to the tune of EUR 6 500 , while an Austrian car worker gets EUR 14 300 ?

In most cases , the collection of relevant data will not impose any additional burden on respondents , since the Member States concerned should be able to compile these data using existing data sources , such as customs documents .
I believe not only that we have a duty to do so , but that we owe it to the victims of human rights abuses in China such as Liu Xiaobo , most of whom have been denied a voice .

The budget underlying this report - which is made explicit in the first item of the compromise proposal &apos;s preamble , accepting an end to dairy quotas - is unacceptable to us , which is why we voted against .
The European Commission deeply appreciates the rationale of this proposal in the motion for a resolution .
It is they who make the decisions , they who are in charge of their own firms , they who decide what to do and how to spend the money and they should not suffer discrimination .
Instead , we pressed on and have now reached a very tricky point , which must be tackled by leaving damaging jealousies and failed economic recipes behind once and for all .
Commissioner , a few people have already mentioned to you that the European legislation that we have in place is , to a certain extent , inadequate , and that it is also inadequately transposed and not monitored sufficiently by the Commission .
The Nabucco pipeline represents a long-term solution , while development of the networks connecting the new Member States could already begin today , using the EUR 5 billion designated for the purpose in the economic stimulus programme .
The current constitutional stalemate in the Republic of Moldova is therefore a concern that must be addressed promptly and efficiently .
The arguments of the American diplomats were not sufficiently convincing to prevent us from being able to find a solution .
I would like to remind you that the level of transparency of political institutions is increasingly linked to its legitimacy .

Gender stereotypes obviously persist in society , which pose an obstacle preventing women from accessing jobs , especially high quality jobs .

Reform of the Financial Regulation offers an additional excellent opportunity to put the fundamental right to good administration into practice .
My decision to vote for the establishment of a financing instrument for cooperation with industrialised countries , which was adopted by an overwhelming majority in this House , fully supports the common line of applying Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union .
In this situation , spending on support for non-agricultural activities and the development of SMEs in rural areas would be at the interface between the two funds and not be covered by either of them .
Indeed , employment is our first concern now .
In any case , this would mean paying guaranteed basic minimum prices for work done and lead to a productive agriculture industry that adds value and provides employment , encouraging agricultural development that respects food sovereignty and combats famine .
In other words , the public must use all the regulations in the most effective way possible , even if they are incomplete and also lead to disparities .
I wonder how anyone can possibly think of blocking these funds , and I call on the Italian Members in particular - who were , moreover , elected by the people of Campania - not to fly into an ideological rage or penalise their fellow citizens .

Yes , we need to examine other tools such as risk insurance and future markets .

Several Roma - including Austrian Roma - have approached me and asked me to bring this up , as fear has gripped the Roma community in Europe once again .
We have chosen to vote against a number of amendments in order to obtain a resolution that is even stronger on the issues that are not already covered by previous programmes and treaties .
Taking into account these quantities , there is a good business case for retrieving more WEEE : more revenue and jobs for the waste treatment sector ; a contribution to the employment of the long-term unemployed and disadvantaged ; recovered material has an estimated value of around EUR 2 billion a year .
We should also acknowledge the Commission &apos;s action plan and the clear deadline that has been set .
With a view to further requests by other countries that want to have similar agreements , we should ensure that every time we reach an agreement , special standards apply .
We have voted against the proposal to ban the trade in seal products and the compromise entered into between Parliament and the Council .

Not only driving times , which are monitored using the tachograph , but also loading and unloading times should now be considered as working time for everyone .
Thirdly , we need to complete the internal market in areas where it is not yet complete - I am expecting a great deal from Mr Monti &apos;s report - including for services .

Mr President , Mr López Garrido , as the Spanish Presidency has just said , last week the Commission , ladies and gentlemen , adopted a communication on clean and energy-efficient vehicles , and I had the pleasure of presenting this text as a priority issue to the members of the Committee on Industry , Research and Energy themselves during my hearing last Wednesday .

By we , I mean our businesses which operate globally and are internationally established , and of course our authorities and administrations .
I would like to thank the rapporteur and the shadow rapporteurs for their excellent support and cooperation on this file .

The financial crisis that the world has gone through has shown that international financial exchanges need to be subject to minimum rules .
They may even be above board , but these deals done outside of the committee ...
This resolution has the support of all the political groups and it is important because , quite simply , it highlights the challenges of an ageing population - these challenges that mean that , today , in Europe , we have more than seven million people suffering from Alzheimer &apos;s disease , a figure that it is estimated will double over the next 20 years .
This collaboration will bring mutual benefits from the scientific and technical progress achieved by our respective research programmes .

Dual-use items are products with two uses .
Now it is going to be , it would appear , subsumed by some sort of EU overseer , consisting no doubt of ignorant bureaucrats , Scandinavian housewives , Bulgarian mafia and Romanian peg-makers .
However , these rules have increased the loan costs for small businesses .
in writing . - ( LV ) These days , Europe &apos;s livestock farmers are experiencing difficulties that we must all overcome together in order to enable the livestock sector to develop and generate enough revenue for farmers .

The IMF should be financed effectively , tax havens should be subject to scrutiny , and financial institutions should be regulated robustly , with an effective European financial services authority overseeing the system : not to drag our economies back into the past , but to create an open , honest and transparent system of trade that is free and fair .
I would be even more delighted if we could bring the same energy and sense of urgency to bear in attending to the good of families and their needs in all European policies .

In countries afflicted by the scourge of civil war , a permanent state of conflict or massacres , the consequences of this situation are catastrophic from a humanitarian and development perspective .
Therefore , the only rational criterion is the level of GDP .
This is the first step towards the extension of this agreement to other regional countries , and towards giving a significant boost to their economies and to the wellbeing of their populations .
The logic behind our draft general budget is quite simple .
The Commission says implementation of anti-corruption instruments is unsatisfactory .
I refer in particular to the targets on methane and nitrous oxide , and the assault on meat and dairy consumption .
According to the reports submitted to Parliament , the implementation of this framework has revealed profound inconsistencies regarding exceptions to the principle of non-eligibility for Union financing of costs related to taxes , duties and other charges .
That is why we should support a mechanism in which all interested parties in the course of choosing a standard are clearly aware of the advantages and disadvantages of one invention or another and of the price they will pay for using the patent .
I voted for the Schnellhardt report on the regulation laying down health rules as regards animal by-products not intended for human consumption , as I consider that the proposals contained in this document will substantially improve the safety of these products , particularly by ensuring traceability throughout the treatment process .
This is a fantastic project , a good beginning , and I would like to thank all of my colleagues who voted for it .
I think it is only fair to start by congratulating Mr Szájer on the excellent report he has presented to us .
As rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Food Safety for the &apos; Proposal for a Council Recommendation on measures to combat neurodegenerative diseases , in particular Alzheimer &apos;s , through joint programming of research activities &apos; , I support the invitation presented by the Conference of Committee Chairs to the European Commission to submit a new proposal on these dossiers so that Parliament is consulted in a manner appropriate to its institutional role also assigned by the provisions of the new Treaty .
I can do nothing more than say that the question of methodology in the measurement of possible limit values has been rigorously debated here in Parliament , in the Council and the Commission .
For all that the fundamentalist regime of the ayatollahs proclaims that its intentions are good and that it is pursuing nuclear energy for peaceful ends , the international community is not convinced and , justifiably , views Iran as a growing threat .
Of course , it is obvious that you have no experience of this .
I agree with the shadow rapporteur of the Group of the European People &apos;s Party ( Christian Democrats ) , Mrs Jeggle , when she says that a more consistent approach to animal welfare is needed , but that does not mean that there is a need for further laws and regulations .
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group . - ( PL ) Mr President , development policy , one of the most important areas of EU policy , aims to resolve global problems .
This is precisely why the EU must endeavour to make the basic principles of the Energy Charter , still to be ratified by Russia , an integral part of the new cooperation agreement .
When it comes to the Greek situation , as you know , a lot has to do with the confidence also in the future of the Greek economy .
How can anyone continue to believe in a deepening of its federal dimension when it is getting ready to fleece the most indebted countries to help out the financial markets ?
I regret , however , that Parliament &apos;s role in this area has been diminished by the Treaty of Lisbon , contrary to the spirit of the treaty and the importance that it confers on Parliament .
Unfortunately , in such a case , transferring money between funds is impossible , due to different rules .
With this clarification you have a new referendum .
To do as this report does and categorically reject the work done by private care providers and non-governmental organisations is definitely not the right way to go about things for someone who genuinely has the welfare of the poor in mind .
Nevertheless , I am surprised that , one year after the military invasion of Gaza , no reference has been made , in these conclusions , to the follow-up to the Goldstone report sought by the Council .

The citizens risk being made fools of : aside from the inconvenience and the unforeseen costs that will be difficult to recoup , air fares may be increased to offset the losses incurred .
President Lula has demonstrated moderation in government and has been a stabilising force against the rise of populist demagogues like Chávez in Venezuela and Morales in Bolivia .

I joined my fellow Conservatives in voting against this report .
When it comes to Kosovo , there is further work , independent of the fact that not all Member States have recognised Kosovo .
We have to assert ourselves and have our voices heard .
If we look at the European Union as a living organism , the European car industry is its backbone .
I think that , particularly in a financial and energy crisis , it is incumbent on us to take an even greater interest in this field and also to respond to the wishes and needs of the population in this regard , because , ultimately , man and nature are not in opposition , but should complement one another .
( HU ) Mr President , the report we have in front of us is perhaps the most important one of this period .
I also welcome the important achievement that the principles of the Treaty , in particular transparency , non-discrimination and openness , will also be implemented in the defence and security market and , as has already been said , this will result in an improvement of the efficiency of defence spending .
It should be stressed that the measures that will aid with the training of the redundant workers will be co-financed by the company , which is not ducking its responsibilities , and will be put into practice by contractors or companies working on its behalf .
However , it does not go far enough , as it allows exceptions to the procedural safeguards in urgent cases , although these must be substantiated and in accordance with the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms .
I should like to congratulate the rapporteur , Mr Sterckx , and the entire negotiating team on achieving a valuable compromise on this important issue .
These are bills to be paid , a sort of legal obligation .

Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I , together with Mr Sassoli and all the members of the Democratic Party within the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament , would like to echo your words of solidarity towards the Italian Prime Minister , Silvio Berlusconi , and stress that this was an abominable , unacceptable and unjustifiable act .
Today , Polish Members of the European Parliament voted against the resolution on the common agricultural policy after 2013 .
The Stockholm Programme constitutes the institutional cornerstone that provides for judicial cooperation and mutual recognition , a European justice system ( made up of the national systems and the Community system ) , both national and Community law , European citizens and European courts ( both national and Community courts ) .
So that is the first response .
The European Union is based on principles such as reconciliation and peaceful coexistence , targeting the same objectives of improving relations between the peoples in the region .
Does the Commission agree that payments should be reviewed if a region has been receiving structural funding for years without this resulting in it meeting the targets set ?
But look at what Tunisia did .
In order to ensure better management of the resources and means at our disposal under the common agricultural policy , I think that we need these two pillars , which must , of course , be complementary and which must have more clearly defined objectives .
A rapid response by the European Union is therefore crucial .
The recommendations and proposals of the European Commission also point in this direction .
Tighter controls on the airline carriers &apos; financial situation , especially in the case of low-cost companies , a tighter control on mergers and takeovers , as well as setting up a sizeable guarantee fund , are a few of the solutions which could , in the long term , offer passengers protection in the event of airline bankruptcy .
A business may say that it is socially responsible when it commits to a robust structure that is capable of taking account not only of economic outcomes , but also of the social and environmental results of its actions .
A series of announcements of plans for group redundancies is reaching employment offices , and this includes over 80 000 Polish shipyard workers who have had their jobs taken away by the European Union , which allows the use of state funds to support other jobs in other countries .
- Thank you , Mr President-in-Office of the European Council , for your determination to continue the work of the Presidency despite the difficult situation in your country .
Secondly , at a time of scarce public funding , the charging for external costs provided by the new directive will generate revenues and make new financial resources available for transport infrastructure .
That is what led me , in paragraphs 17 and 18 , of which I am the author , to ask the Commission for an enquiry to determine whether there are any cartels operating .
Will the country remain at peace or will it sink into another war ?
First of all , an explicit reminder of the added value of European territorial cooperation and of its potential for increased competitiveness .
We have seen and we have heard of 15 000 minors in prisons , we have heard of hundreds of arrests on dubious charges , we are aware that the Kurdish problem is still continuing and above all the Armenian problem , the ageold problem that is absolutely still alive to this day .
The generous derogations in the proposal would have been impossible to monitor given the widespread nature of the hunting over a period of 10 days each year .
We should stand with workers in China .
The amendments to be tabled to Regulation ( EC ) No 861 / 2006 should help to allow the specified cofinancing rates of clearly defined common financing to be raised in the area of the Law of the Sea .
The European Parliament is not asking for a generally ambitious budget , but for an instrument that is strong on all the priorities that are today clear and easy to see .
It is time for us to talk about a genuine European energy strategy .
The European Union must develop and support entrepreneurship among women in order to help create jobs and guarantee equal opportunities on the labour market , especially at the current time .
The Commission will discuss the options and possible sensible and necessary programme amendments in the short term with the administrative authorities in Portugal .

Regarding the points made by Mr Geier : fraud has no specific national borders .
The European Globalisation Adjustment Fund ( EGF ) was set up to provide additional assistance to workers affected by the consequences of major changes in the structure of international trade .
I cannot endorse this proposal for the time being .
For this reason , your call , Mr Barroso , for cooperation with Parliament is correct , but it comes too late .
in writing . - ( LT ) The universality of the current financial crisis means it will affect Member States regardless of their economic structure , therefore the rapporteur believes that we must re-evaluate the right of employees to be informed and consulted .
Let us remember that the revolt in these countries of the Middle East and the Mediterranean has not been about ideology but about bread , a revolt for democracy in order to survive .
Like everyone else , I believe that we should remember the context in which this report is set , and that , of course , is the youth crisis that we are experiencing in Europe .
If the Commission wants to accelerate action on the part of businesses and Member States , then it , too , must be credible and really bring this very good strategy , and also an infrastructure package , into force .
We therefore have cause to celebrate .
It is true that Switzerland must pay CHF 600 million per year for access , but the Swiss Government reports savings for not being a member of the EU amounting to CHF 3.4 billion , a net saving of CHF 2.8 billion a year .
This is not my analysis , it is the analysis of the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) , of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development ( OECD , of Mr Trichet , who is , after all , the head of the euro &apos;s monetary guardian , the President of the European Central Bank , and for whom all the measures that have been taken and all the measures that are in the pipeline do not go far enough .
Decisions shall be taken as openly and as closely as possible to the citizen , thus conferring greater legitimacy on the institutions in the eyes of European citizens , at the same time as helping to increase their confidence in them .
Europe &apos;s SMEs are highly dependent on bank financing - in comparison with American enterprises , for example .
If this is implemented , the equal treatment directive will mean that owners and our landlords will now , in some cases , have to make deals that they had hitherto been able to refuse .
Even if some individuals do attempt to engage in this activity , we shall have more effective instruments available with which to deal with them .
She did not use the word &apos; only &apos; but she might easily have done .

( SK ) Had it not been for the previous speaker , yourself and the Minister , we would have been a women &apos;s group discussing how to improve gender equality .

The United States of America , China and Japan have chosen a route that has rejected the UNled model , with its negotiated emission ceilings and timetables .
( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I listened very attentively to the speeches by the Commission , the Presidency and my fellow Members .
The problem of liquidity and leverage ratios has not been resolved , any more than that of off-balance sheet assets and securitisation .
It incorporates the condemnation of historical criteria for allocating aid to farmers and their replacement with new criteria , essentially based around the environment , the intention to move towards fairer distribution of support among farmers and Member States , as has been reiterated by several of my colleagues , and acknowledges that market regulation and risk and crisis management must have appropriate policy instruments .
Those who , like myself , are opposed to Ankara joining the EU find in them confirmation of their own traditional objections to the accession : in Turkey , there are still restrictions on fundamental freedoms , human rights violations , an aggressive attitude towards Cyprus and Greece , and discrimination against ethnic and religious minorities - all of which are problems that Europe clearly cannot ignore .
India is achieving a new status in the international geopolitical context , going from being a beneficiary of development aid to a donor .
It is of course beneficial in the long term , but Member States have not invested in the appropriate infrastructure and that is why it has taken so much time .
When examining the applications , the Member States must look at the relevant specific individual circumstances so as to determine each applicant &apos;s need for protection , if any .
However , I do support the measures to encourage young farmers , who currently represent just 7 % of the total , with installation premiums , subsidised interest rates on loans and other incentives which have been implemented by Member States through their rural development budgets , safe in the knowledge that European agricultural production can maintain its current high levels of quality and safety .
I am going to refer to Mr Jáuregui Atondo &apos;s report .
This is why I have assumed the responsibility of being the rapporteur for this regulation , as well as for the European Parliament report adopted at the beginning of the month concerning the administrative and legal barriers raised by Member States preventing the freedom of movement of European citizens .
Moreover , before reaching adulthood , women are young girls , and violence against a young girl will prevent her from enjoying life forever .
Mr President , there is no other way , if we want a lasting solution , to generate new jobs or to stand in solidarity with those most in need at this difficult time .
From the experience of Northern Ireland , we can see that their contributions prevented many people from losing their lives ; of that I have no doubt .
For us this is a vital aspect to make progress .
As regards migration , I would question what guarantees we can receive from a nation that protects criminals and swindlers like Cesare Battisti and the &apos; wizard &apos; Mário Pacheco do Nascimiento .
Vice-President of the Commission . - ( DE ) Madam President , honourable Members , we always discuss toys just before Christmas , and quite rightly so , as this is the time when people are most interested in toys .

For the statistical offices , it will be easy to calculate how high the tax revenue , social insurance contributions and pension payments are .
In conclusion , I would like once more to applaud the rapporteur for the work she has carried out in submitting a report and amendments that will enable both of the lawmaking bodies to concentrate on the main problem that remains to be resolved , namely the funding .
There has been debate in Parliament , but above all strong resistance in the Council , and economic powers have been mobilised in force in defence of vested interests .
( DE ) Madam President , contrary to the view of those advocates of the EU who wear rose-tinted glasses , accession to the Union alone is not enough to resolve all conflicts just like that .
I agree with the rapporteur when he highlights the need , given the new competences conferred by the Treaty of Lisbon , for the European Parliament to monitor the various stages of negotiating and implementing the VPA , and when he calls on the Commission to provide Parliament with studies of the agreement &apos;s social , economic and environmental impact , amongst other documents for assessing its implementation .
I have been following the situation very closely with this government and with the previous government , namely the question of public finances .
The campaign launched against representatives of the mass media and opposition parties , along with the arrest and expulsion of journalists are serious , deplorable actions .
Finally , Madam High Representative , you will be making a trip to the Middle East .
Today , 8 March 2010 , I solemnly request that the European Union act as guarantor of the future of Afghanistan &apos;s women , as the re-emergence of the most femicidal regime in history cannot be countenanced .
A large proportion of Parliament , like the Spanish delegation of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament , has formally opposed paragraph 41 of this resolution , which asks for the principle of subsidiarity to be applied to land policy .
in writing . - I voted in favour of this resolution , together with the big majority of the Chamber .
Your vote is therefore crucial to helping us move forward on this and other important issues .
Since March 2009 , Colombo has been holding almost all of the civilians who fled the fighting between the army and the Tamil Tigers , in complete violation of international law and human rights .
I would say that , besides what we have been trying to do , whether successfully or not so far , we are now trying to have not only friends around us , but also friends who are friends amongst themselves .
This year , the report is more critical , and , unfortunately , rightly draws attention to the small amount of progress made by Turkey , especially on questions of citizens &apos; freedoms and the justice system .
You will all feel the effects in your own purses and your own accounts .
Given the stricter levels that are being imposed in Japan we , the Commission , have decided that it would be correct to amend the present levels in force since 25 March as an additional safeguard measure pending further scientific analysis of the levels established under Euratom Regulation 3954 / 87 .
Vice-President of the Commission . - ( IT ) Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , today &apos;s debate has shown broad support for the common position on animal by-products , and this enables the Commission to proceed with the next stage .
The first level being between the Member States themselves .
It is vital that the outermost regions be looked at particularly carefully by the EU and be included in its responses to mitigate the effects of the current crisis .
( EL ) Madam President , I believe that this entire issue has arisen due to a lack of information for consumers and the public .

The Commission has established an effective mode of cooperation with all local actors working in Kosovo , including EULEX and the EU &apos;s Special Representative .
Furthermore , there should be support for academic entrepreneurship , making it a component of study programmes .
When we refer to the financial , economic and social crisis that we are currently experiencing , we are talking about a global crisis in which special attention must be given to developing countries , which have suffered the impact of this crisis both directly and indirectly .
I do not understand how there can be Members of Parliament here who do not hesitate to advocate austerity policies and the reduction of wages and pensions in their countries , but when it comes to making decisions about their own money , austerity goes out of the window .
For this reason , I would ask the Council to reconsider this issue very carefully .
I am sorry that he is not here in the House .
We should be using real and hard instruments to change things in Libya , Syria , Camp Ashraf and Belarus .
As was mentioned by some of you , the idea is to solve problems , but by imposing fines if there is no other way to solve the problems , because that is my duty .

Yes , it is up to our experts to start this revolution , but the European Union - I am about to finish - must take the lead and conquer this territory of the infinitely small .
The same applies to our neighbouring country of Sweden , for example , and therefore such initiatives as this serious strategy provide a sound contribution for future debate .
It will also be a vote and a victory for all of us who have refused to take &apos; no &apos; for an answer .
Many remain unknown , but the bravery and devotion of all of them deserve to be remembered .
Looking at the checkpoint , where there was no formal communication on either side , it certainly did look like a scene from the Cold War .
The first major step towards Europe was taken with the signing of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement , but that was just the beginning .
The aim is to strengthen the Union by allowing the Member States to have a greater involvement and increasingly to pool their currently separate efforts in relation to the CFSP .
( PT ) I should like to congratulate the rapporteur and the Azorean fishermen present here today .
This may also give a new lease of life to Romania &apos;s relations with Ukraine .
Therefore , the Commission has before it the urgent task of resolving conflicts concerning the use of minority languages in all the countries of the EU , without exception .
Let us remember that there are entire communities that survive on this ancient activity , which dates back at least 11 200 years , so much so that in some cases , UNESCO considers it an activity to be preserved and promoted .
( PL ) ( initially the microphone was turned off ) tragic periods in the history of humanity .
Considering that our analysis of progress in achieving the Lisbon objectives is not encouraging , we welcome the call expressed in the resolution to speed up legislative changes in Member States , to tighten up infringement procedures and encourage greater participation of women in key sectors of the labour market that reflects the goals they have achieved as far as training is concerned .
It is , in the interest of good law-making , highly desirable to maintain parallelism between the two texts .
As Diego has already said , I am also convinced that this would lead to stronger , better cross-border Europe-wide debates in Europe , more on European topics , and not only on national topics that we see so often in the capitals of our Member States .
The Commission considers that children become dangerous at six years old and must therefore give fingerprints which are incorporated in personal passports from that age , while the European Parliament , demonstrating its &apos; democratic sensibilities &apos; , considers that children must be put on file when they are slightly older , namely at 12 years of age .
Moreover , Parliament calls on the Commission to not just take into account unemployment and social problems , but to show effective means of solving these , so that this new strategy has a genuine impact on people &apos;s real lives .
The daily bloodbath , the organisation of violent and corrupt elections to put puppets of the Afghan occupation in place and the poverty and misery which are the scourge of the Afghan people reveal that the imperialist attacks by the United States of America , the European Union and ΝΑΤΟ in this occupied country - and in a series of other countries - on the pretext of combating terrorism have disastrous consequences for the people .
In the case of local public transport , it will be easy to include provisions in the requirement specifications for tenders which state that passengers &apos; rights must be respected and reinforced .
Any attempt to enable the regulations in force to be employed with greater speed and agility will create added value for the whole territory of the European Union .
These things are covered to a certain extent by corporate social responsibility , but they cannot be implemented without a national framework .
Member of the Commission . - Since the outbreak of the economic crisis , the European Union has taken a firm stance against straight protectionism , consistent with its commitment to fair and open trade .
It is in this spirit that we will be making proposals for the CAP post-2013 .
Although we have long known these facts , and although political consensus has prevailed between Parliament , the Commission and the Council for at least a year , there has been no final decision .
In order that there may be an amendment to Rule 51 of the Rules of Procedure of the European Parliament on procedures with joint committee meetings , I express my vote in favour of the proposal in question .
Following the remarks I have heard here , I think that this compromise is actually even better than I had thought , for the simple reason - and this I address particularly to my fellow Members from the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe and my fellow Member from the Dutch Christian Democratic Appeal ( CDA ) - that creating a transitional arrangement does not mean that we wish to throttle the internal market - if I may use that expression - or businesses .
I therefore voted in favour .
In fact , let me give you a higher and better authority even than John Maynard Keynes .
I also approve the motion to declare a &apos; European day of remembrance &apos; for the victims of all totalitarian and authoritarian regimes .
In order to address the issue of counterfeiting , I believe it is vitally important to have the maximum cooperation between the police , the European Central Bank , which you have already referred to , and the European Commission .
Even though there is a small minority in Parliament , and evidently also some people in the Commission and the Member States , who believe that we should steer clear from anything that is related to towns , it is abundantly clear that Europe offers added value when it comes to addressing problems that are considerable and largely shared .
We must ensure , therefore , that humanitarian aid and humanitarian aid workers have better access to populations in need , and as there are more of these populations these days , we must succeed in doing even more than we have done so far , through the Commission or through bilateral programmes .
Russia appears to have equally little interest and sees the expansion of the EU and NATO as an intrusion in its historic sphere of influence .
The External Action Service led by Baroness Ashton seems to have been caught by surprise and in my opinion is now demonstrating a poor response capacity .
( BG ) We have witnessed over recent months a number of incidents involving the hijacking of ships by Somali pirates for ransom .
In order to manage serious falls in the market more effectively , agricultural policy needs tools which allow it to react rapidly , consistently and without a lot of red tape .

This temporary suspension of taxes , allowing local economic operators in the Azores and Madeira to import a certain amount of raw materials , parts , components and finished products duty-free , covering areas such as fishing , agriculture , industry and services , provides favourable conditions for long-term investment .
It is absolutely imperative , then , to provide ourselves with the best possible budgets , so that we are far more effective within the context of this European civil protection mechanism .

Mr Mann &apos;s report is detailed and well structured and has fully incorporated the suggestions made by the Committee on Women &apos;s Rights and Gender Equality , granting gender its just and necessary importance in this subject area .

I would like to call on the Commissioner to make use of the revenue generated through the emissions trading system in order to actually resolve the CO2 problem .

The EU has an important role in fostering the sustainable social and economic development of the ACP countries and in contributing to the general efforts to eradicate poverty in those countries .
However , things have changed now , and the money is running out .
Mrs Oviir , your fan club has stayed to the end .
Secondly , I believe that the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina , Albania and Kosovo also deserve visa-free travel as soon as possible .
This national minister simply needs to come to an agreement with his regional ministers , await their regional policy statements and management declarations and then present them all to this House and to the public .
We should , however , exercise caution when it comes to prescribing detailed sentences for this abuse at European level .
I think everybody is saying this this morning , and we have all been saying the same thing for the past fortnight .
What we are seeing is an attempt to manipulate the trade policy of the European Union - which , unfortunately , the UK is bound by for the moment - in order to implement by stealth a largely Socialist agenda that has been consistently rejected .
We stand for freedom of access to our cultural heritage and daily intergenerational and neighbourly solidarity .
Let us , in any case , have the debate tomorrow : subsequently , we will find the time and the means to address the issue in the context of Europe and vote on a resolution on the freedom of information in Europe .
We have already had this system abused by Mr Le Pen and his Front National when in 1989 Claude Autant-Lara was parachuted into this Parliament and made a farce of the opening of the institution with a lengthy and highly offensive intervention .
It is in large part about coordinating the exercise of national competences whilst making full use of the European Union competences and instruments available .
Furthermore the EU needs to diversify its gas resources and supply routes .
In addition , I have proposed that we be more ambitious and say that the European Union should free up 1 200 MHz in the 1.5 GHz band and the 2.3 GHz band , and that we should also start the discussion about the 700 MHz band - because if we do not start it now , we will not have the opportunity to take decisions in the future - and we should use the 5 GHz band for common licence-free use for all short-distance mobile Internet communications .
Please tell us the truth .
I would like to draw the Commission &apos;s attention to the paragraph of the resolution which calls on Russia not to use the supply of energy resources as a tool for influencing its neighbours &apos; policies .
Achieving a minimum 25 % reduction in the EU poverty level by 2020 is a target closely linked to the growth of employment among the population , which is a priority of the social inclusion policy .

It is now time that we took the important next step , because the European project cannot be limited to a pure , bald financial-monetary project .
Mr President , Mrs Malmström , ladies and gentlemen , I am delighted that the Swedish Presidency has put cooperation in the Baltic Sea area at the top of its agenda .
I would like to underline that the recession was further exacerbated by the fact that the various national economic recovery plans are insufficiently coordinated , because it is highly likely that with coordination at European Union level , it would be possible to have a greater impact than that which can be achieved with most programmes at national level .
You proposed a UK conservative , Mr Patten .
At this very moment , while we are discussing all this within this Chamber , a serious incident is taking place between Malta and Italy , which is the third of its kind in the space of a few days .
So broadband is one of the issues for the future .
I would suggest that , at this moment of direct talks , it might not be advisable for the European Parliament to include in its report any proposal for derogations from the acquis .
The third key area for resolving the crisis is therefore the restoration of confidence .
That is something that we will also have to work on .
rapporteur . - Mr President , we have been talking about European contract law for over a decade ; now is the time for action , and if ever there was a time when the Internal Market needed a boost in terms of additional transactions , it is now .
This report repeats the European Commission &apos;s standard rhetoric on issues of lifelong learning and promotion of mobility at EU level , which are considered to be the best guarantee against unemployment , and the need for workers to improve their &apos; employability &apos; and &apos; adaptability &apos; , so as to organise the supply of education and training .
Concerning VAT , I would like to be precise .
( DE ) Madam President , Mrs Malmström , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , we were all delighted about the proposed liberalisation of visas .

The European Union must maintain its leading position in the battle against climate change , which must not slip to number two as a result of the current economic difficulties .
Therefore , it is essential , too , that the debate on gender equality should also include the matter of the entitlement to benefits of women who run the home and care for children .
On the one hand , one can say that it proves what many critics have said , that the European Union is far too bureaucratic , but at least we have the integrity and the guts to face up to the fact and take corrective action - unlike the banks , which have so far shown no culpability and no remorse for their actions .
Honourable Members , the Spanish Presidency attaches very high priority to this dossier , as you know , and the Spanish Presidency would like to reach an agreement before the end of June .

The disasters of last year were a salutary reminder that the EU and its Member States need to step up work on disaster prevention .

Other positive points include making ecological sustainability the basic premise of the CFP and the recognition that EU fleets must no longer overfish in the waters of developing countries .

Not much has changed and now I bring mine here in March 2010 .
Secondly , while we are on the subject of financing , it is intended that a large proportion of the money will come from trade in emissions allowances .
Now we face the practical issue of whether we should support them or not .
( ES ) Mr Zapatero , I will now address you in your mother tongue , which is also my own .
in writing . - The European Parliament legislative resolution on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on roll-over protection structures mounted in front of the driver &apos;s seat on narrow-track wheeled agricultural and forestry tractors is very timely .
The US is investing huge amounts of money in green technology .
If you wanted to protest , you should have done so there and then .

I am very pleased that Commissioner Benita Ferrero-Waldner is also with us today .
Today , I endorsed the Cadec report , which raises many important aspects of the protection of the EU market for aquaculture products in the context of reform of the common fisheries policy .
Consequently , I believe that it is very important that such a tone , a tone demanding the restoration of constitutional power and the restoration of President Zelaya , serves as Parliament &apos;s identifying feature .
This is not an issue for political grandstanding or , indeed , promoting pet projects .
It is in full knowledge of the facts that I refused to give my approval to Mr Vítor Constâncio &apos;s nomination as future Vice-President of the European Central Bank .
in writing . - I voted against Amendment 103 in the Catania report , which proposed that long-term non-citizens should participate in elections to the European Parliament as well in local elections in order to promote social and political integration .
In May , the Council agreed to reverse qualified majority voting in two places in addition to the general approach .
Our traditions and our regional identity are what characterises our wine , and that should also guide us in the deliberations we are now having on the wine market regulations .
It is also of the utmost importance to improve access to medical services and cancer screening programmes for women .
We will not build a truly unified European Union if people are not convinced that the whole of Europe is their home .
We cannot , however , continue to adopt separate new initiatives without a comprehensive master plan for the EU &apos;s border strategy .
As we state in the resolution , we hope that the authorities will soon accept international assistance and open the camps to receive humanitarian aid and trained conflict personnel .
To tell us that we have to wait for the language versions is unacceptable when we know that there are several versions circulating in the press , following leaks of information .
I will be sticking to my recommendation that you , Mr President , invite a Non-Inscrit to attend the Conference of Presidents .
Unfortunately , errors have occurred repeatedly in the past and this makes it even more important to impose quality and safety standards in this area .
The Commission very much welcomes the valuable input of Parliament and looks forward to continued collaboration with Parliament , Member States and stakeholders from all sectors , with the common aim of protecting the health of citizens throughout the European Union .
On this point , the situation of the Roma , whose issues represent a special case and a degree of difficulty in a league of their own , speaks for itself .
This is a poor solution ; this is not the right solution !
I would like to thank Mrs Laperrouze for this report and say that I support the majority of its conclusions .
This question asks the Commission if it is attempting to mainstream the social protection and inclusion process in the provision of medium-term financial assistance for Member States &apos; balances of payments under Council Regulation ( EC ) No 332 / 2002 .
We need to make sure that the US does not back-track on its Copenhagen commitments and we must encourage them to contribute to a successful outcome of the COP 16 meeting in Cancún .
( FI ) Mr President , I wish to thank Commissioner Georgieva for the work that the Commission has done .
Apart from any environmental romanticism , we must not forget European industry .
In this respect , the persecution of Mrs Shirin Ebadi is a very serious matter , and I can also say the same about the situation of the six students which was mentioned earlier .
Perhaps in future , however , people will simply need to delete their RFID number from Google Street View .
Mexico has shown interest and readiness in discussing with the European Union all these issues , most recently during the session of the EU-Mexico Joint Committee held in Brussels on 26-27 November 2009 .
At any rate , I take issue with the excessive use of fingerprinting or the use of biometric data .
We will , of course , be working on monitoring and evaluations , together with Parliament , so will have a very good opportunity to discuss this in detail .
Today , we are therefore in effect setting out a road map which should allow parliamentarians , public bodies and civil society to exercise ongoing , extreme vigilance in the very important areas you have mentioned .
We know that some members of the Council do not agree with increasing the budget - we have seen as much here .
I apologise once again .
With regard to the European Convention on Human Rights , there is little to add to the speech made by Mr Jáuregui and to his excellent report , which was drafted along with the rapporteurs for the opinion , Mr Preda and Mrs Gál , on the issue of the European Union signing the European Convention on Human Rights .
No Member State should now be allowed to worm their way out of these obligations .
Then it is rather unsatisfactory to hear colleagues from the ECR Group say that everything that happens here is substandard - knowing quite well that responsibility lies somewhere else entirely .
However , the least we can do is to include the polluting value of tar sand oil in the Fuel Quality Directive .
If we are to come through the crisis , we need more Europe rather than less Europe ; we need to measure up to our past and to the challenges of the future ; we need to give confidence and hope to the European public , without whom there is no European project .
Germany and Austria wish to maintain this restriction until 2011 , without any more serious economic and social motive .
I am very concerned about the particular vulnerability of individuals from various minority groups and I believe that action needs to be taken , both at national and international level .
There have been reports of several people being wounded and killed in clashes taking place across the country between the police and people demonstrating against President Mubarak &apos;s government .
I also believe that we can use electromobility to revitalise the mobility economy in Europe , and we need to do that in order to create value and to safeguard jobs .
Therefore , the Commission must respond now .
I think it is appropriate that in these circumstances - and this has not been contradicted - a country such as Nicaragua is bold enough to expel a politician of this kind .
Yet , at the same time , the same EU deems it appropriate that the budget of this place increases by 6 % .
I also welcome the fact that the new protocol includes a suspension clause in case of human rights violations .
( RO ) The events which have occurred in the Republic of Moldova had been on the cards for a long time .
Unfortunately , because of changes to the calendar of work of the Committee on Legal Affairs , my opinion was not taken into consideration by the committee responsible for the directive - the Committee on Industry , Research and Energy - which by a very small majority voted to accept the Euratom Treaty as the only legal basis .
We have to introduce economic governance , find solutions to the sovereign debt crisis , and implement the EU 2020 strategy much more quickly - to name but a few of the aims in the economic field .
( LV ) Mr President , nuclear energy currently generates approximately one third of total energy consumption in Europe .
I hope that the Council adopts the mandate as presented and that Parliament is kept fully and promptly informed of all developments in the negotiations , bearing in mind that Parliament will have the final word on the future agreement .
I agree with you , and the Commission is aware of the complexity of these problems .
Therefore , the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , the European Commission and the euro area Member States must encourage the process of integration in the area of economic and monetary policy in the European Union and support the expansion of the euro area .
This really concerns us , not because we do not believe that the focus of the cohesion policy should be extended , but because we think that without additional resources , this extension risks depriving and reducing the resources for the areas referred to in Objective 1 - the so-called convergence objective - which need just as much attention and support from the European Union .
Accordingly , the Council welcomes with great pleasure the Commission &apos;s communication on the review of the Small Business Act , which was published on 23 February 2011 .
A further reason is the fact that it has already been revealed in the hearings that not a single one of the new European commissioners is prepared to do anything about the democratic deficit .
While I agree that no one should force women to wear such clothing , I am concerned that a ban might result in an outcome the exact opposite of that intended : women who are prepared to wear the burkha going to prison .
The experts in Iceland say that it is not a matter of whether there will be further eruptions - the question is merely when they will occur .
But , if used sustainably , and if the maximum residue levels and withdrawal period are respected , they are of minimum risk , and of none at all to the consumer .
We should not condemn small undertakings when they face the problem of providing transport services ; I refer here to cabotage , about which I have questioned the Commissioner on other occasions .
in writing . - We , as Greens , have voted in favour of the report by our colleague , Helga Trüpel .
However , the EPC cannot be changed by the Member States of the European Union acting unilaterally because the EPC includes all European countries , with the exception , I believe , of Malta .
This can be done through effective investments in agriculture , education and health , as well as in the transport and energy infrastructure .
We want to be involved in this .
What has happened in the last few days does not relate to procedure but to content .
I therefore welcome Mrs Gebhardt &apos;s report .
in writing . - I have finally voted in favour of the report , known also as the annual report on the CFSP , mainly because two of our five amendments were adopted ( the one on the Transatlantic Legislators &apos; Dialogue and the one about the expectation that a strategic relationship between the EU and China will be developed ) .
I voted in favour of the report submitted by Mrs Batzeli ( Greece ) as I believe that the EU must come to the aid of producers and consumers .
This is a complex issue , especially since negotiations with our international partners run in parallel to our own internal discussions .
As the French winner of the Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences , Maurice Allais , pointed out , free trade is only mutually beneficial if it is between countries with comparable levels of development , and further to that , I would add , if it is in targeted areas with the strategic sectors of each country remaining protected .
We already know about the suppression of the ancient Buddhist Tibetan culture over the last 60 years ; now we see the same threat looming over the city of Kashgar in the restive province of Xinjiang .
I also believe that this agreement is of the utmost importance , as this country is the main African exporter of timber to Europe , and there are serious problems at several levels of governance , such as environmental degradation and corruption .
Hence , I am waiting for those proposals to be submitted and for measures that can finally provide an answer to service providers and local and regional authorities , but also recognise the vital contribution that these services make to social and territorial cohesion .
There are countries , the USA for example , where other forms of indirect taxation are applied and which , generally speaking , lead to a more dynamic , flexible and efficient economy .
The Chair , the rapporteurs and the shadow rapporteurs have all represented this House with great distinction .
So I think that , even if colleagues in this Parliament may differ on the margin about the most responsible way forward , I think it is very significant that we are all behind this resolution .
It is clear that we still have much to improve as regards our capacity for coordination , and much to improve too in the decision-making process .
In this respect , I support the intervention of the Commission , together with the Member States , to defend consumers &apos; legitimate rights and expectations whenever there is evidence of use of fraudulent or misleading origin markings by non-EU importers and producers .
It must be clearly explained to those people who want to migrate that the streets of Europe are not paved with gold , that Europe cannot provide jobs , prosperity and asylum for everyone and that many of these traumatic journeys end in detention and deportation .
It involves not just the provision of the basis ingredients of food production , such as seeds and fertilisers , but also the know-how , the advisory services , the assistance to farming families in the developing world to allow them to produce to meet their own needs .
President-in-Office , Ms Harkin has asked a very important question and you have answered it very well but , broadening out the scope of the question , ageism is generally regarded nowadays as 65-plus .
The measures proposed are commendable and consist of :
in writing . - In my capacity of EURONEST Vice-President , I voted in favour of the macro-financial assistance for Ukraine .
All those who defend freedom of movement on the Internet and free software are to be congratulated .
And we needed to complement it with greater inclusion of citizens in this process , through this instrument of participatory democracy .
I hope that further work on the directive will move towards eliminating this phenomenon .
This motion for a resolution reaffirms Europeans &apos; commitment to the root-and-branch reforms sought by the people of Tunisia .
The Regional Development Committee of the European Parliament has reached a position as to how it sees cohesion policy post-2013 .
In this connection , I should like to reiterate the broader proposal I made on previous occasions , namely that it would be appropriate also to enhance young Europeans &apos; knowledge of the Union by making this a compulsory subject in the upper secondary school curriculum .
It is also clear that strategic input is expected to be matched by a very practical commitment , so I believe that you will remember this when we are discussing our practical contribution to the future Afghan mission .
These two years of terrible global economic crisis have shown that the euro has firmly anchored us to stability .
Both of these are strong reasons why we should not withdraw supporting measures until we have secured our recovery .
I would agree that there is a need today for the necessary works , infrastructure works , and that we also need regulations governing how agreements are executed .
I have spoken to regional banks , who stressed very clearly to me that it would not be a problem for them at all if financial reporting was changed ; they use other data any way .
There is reason enough to think that this was not by accident , but by design .
The sportspeople concerned often speak excellent English ; however , it is often not easy to understand a subject which is already complex in itself in a subject-specific jargon in another language .
I voted in favour of the report on the future of the CAP post-2013 because it is necessary to strengthen CAP policies and ensure an adequate budget in order to respond to the challenges that European agriculture is facing , such as climate change , food security and quality and the competitiveness of the sector .
I would like to emphasise that this directive has very great potential for creating new jobs : roughly 500 000 jobs could be created at European level , with major implications for the regional or national labour market .
That the parliaments of 26 countries have ratified the Treaty of Lisbon shows that it is a parliamentary treaty .
Therefore , I voted against this report .
Last but not least , in reply to Mr Verhofstadt , it is unwise to single out any one Member State when there are a number of Member States which are net contributors to the budget .
I want to congratulate the Czech Republic on taking over the Presidency of the European Union .
We have to ensure that the work environment is pleasant .
Businesses that operate in a globally responsible way help shape foreign policy and development policy .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , thank you Mr Barrot and Mr Billström .
The issues as raised by the honourable Members are firstly on information and secondly on storage .
Providing impetus for further research into modern energy technologies , such as the innovation involving fusion-based reactors , is also indispensable .
One solution could be to oblige initiators to maintain an Internet site containing financial information , such as sources of income , expenses and financial reports .
This was brought home very clearly to me two weeks ago when the volcanic ash struck .
in writing . - I and my British Conservative colleagues welcome the strategic approach on the supply of energy as contained in the Laperrouze report on the Second Strategic Energy Review .
That is clear from Eurostat statistics : it was approximately 90 % in both 2007 and 2008 .
After all , the two legislative instruments are inextricably interlinked .
Europe has never closed the door to such discussions , and it remains open today .
It is also worth stressing the fact that the charges are to be lower the higher the ecological category of the heavy goods vehicle .
I believe that the development of this strategy will enable us to achieve significant results in the fight against unemployment .
It is important that we try to get the maximum support for this report at the end .
The European Union owes its success to the gradual raising of economic barriers .
Claims to access for disabled persons are circumvented in my country with translation tricks .
I agree with President Barroso when he states that the Greek Government must do everything it can to put its house in order so that the European Union can , in turn , take action .
I would also like to reiterate that we are going to increase scientific research into aquaculture species , because we really need to proceed to mass production of these aquaculture products if we really want aquaculture to be an alternative to our fishing sector .
( SL ) With his populist and hard-line nationalist rhetoric , President Ahmadinejad is causing great damage to Iran &apos;s image and reputation .
The speculators did indeed profit from your statements .
This also means , however , accepting the sovereign rights of neighbouring states and their decisions as regards entering into the alliances that they wish to enter into .
Very close cooperation will be needed in order to follow up the agreements that we reached at the G20 summit and to restore confidence in the financial markets .
We need only look at information coming in from several Member States , and also the increased threat levels in a number of countries , such as France and Spain .
That means that , for this particular proposed regulation , there is still much to be done .
It is worth emphasising the importance and relevance of this fund in these times of economic recession that we are experiencing .
The next item is the Commission statement on the pharmaceutical products package .
( FR ) Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , in the Europe of the Stability Pact - and tomorrow the competitiveness pact - pension reforms are in the firing line .
That is confirmed by the draft resolution .
( PL ) Madam President , President-in-Office , it is paradoxical that this multiple crisis that has afflicted the world , including Europe , can also be a great ally , as those who have got used to telling everyone how to run their business bear the brunt of the responsibility for this crisis .
I voted in favour of the report by my colleague , Mrs Göncz , because I feel it is crucial , especially in the context of an employment crisis and of a social crisis , to support micro-finance by providing it with a specific budget line .
I do not think this is the path to be taking ; quite the reverse .
I know of dramatic examples in Poland of children being taken away from their mothers , including one case in which a family court removed a 10 year-old boy from his mother because the mother was accused of praying too much .
I would like to finish on this , Mr President .
I think that what he said is very important when we come to reform cohesion policy .
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group . - ( SL ) Climate change is a vast field and I would agree with the rapporteur when he says that we , members of the Temporary Committee on Climate Change , had to find innovative means in order to encompass the full breadth and content of this field .
I would also like to mention that my country , Romania , has provided support to the United States &apos; efforts in both Iraq and Afghanistan .
The current legal framework in the EU does not provide for a minimum level of treatment for victims throughout the EU irrespective of where they have been victimised , and that is why the Commission intends to act to strengthen the position of victims in Europe .
We will consider whether the new capacities that are expected will match the forecasts of future demand or whether we can expect shortfalls .
With regard to the directive to combat sexual abuse , we are working on reaching a common position in June .
The Commission was glad to see , in various parts of the report , that there is full recognition that the main objective of the EU funding was , first and foremost , to ensure that the reactor units were closed and remained so for nuclear safety reasons .
Unlike most other victims of persecution in Iran , Shirin Ebadi is not anonymous but internationally known and respected .
Recital 5 states that female genital mutilation constitutes a violation of human rights and that an increasing number of asylum requests by parents are justified by the threat to which they may be subject in their own country for having refused to consent to their child undergoing FGM .
The late President Conté himself seized power in a military coup , and now there is a sense of déjà vu .
There are problems , but for Heaven &apos;s sake let us not to look at these countries , countries which are trying to make progress , through the prism of Western countries , because if we were to use that parameter , a parameter which someone is using this morning with regard to Tunisia , then certain European countries would probably be denied entry into the European Union , because the violence and denial of freedom which exists there is on a greater scale than in Tunisia .
Once the legislative proposals are made , we are counting on being able to create a special partnership with you and the Commission , which will afford an opportunity for the swift examination and adoption of the main measures designated in the final Single Market Act .
Now we find ourselves debating the databases and police practices of the future .
We must therefore put a plan in place , and I am among those who were ready , almost 10 years ago now , to consider a joint crisis organisation , so that we can sell all the wood which has now been placed on the market rather involuntarily , without affecting the price : we could do this by blocking supplies from other European regions , by funding transport and by making sure that this land can be replanted very quickly ; otherwise , I think it will become subject to speculation , or even abandoned .
I believe that the EU does not have competence in this area ; nor should it have .
Last year gave us hope that relations between the European Union and Belarus can change and that the fences I mentioned can be lowered .
We need information , but without advance authorisation .
Their roles are defined and different , but in any case , there is a risk of duplication in some areas .
The waste crisis in Italy , and particularly in the province of Campania , has been going on for years .
The report advocates giving the European Union a seat on the United Nations ( UN ) General Assembly and a permanent seat on the Security Council .
Before speculating on any very hypothetical future outcome concerning Turkey &apos;s accession process , I will simply say that the Commission has noted , for the second year running , that no progress was made on the Ankara Protocol and that that prevented any new negotiating chapters from being opened .
You know that at the first stage , we are proposing a regime for the euro area Member States and , at the second stage , for all 27 Member States .
I myself have said in no uncertain terms - including in the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection and in the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Food Safety - that I would like to see health portals on the Internet and similar information in printed media .
I urgently requested that this issue be discussed in plenary once more , not only because it concerns thousands of workers in my back yard , Antwerp in Flanders - you will see that many Members of the European Parliament will take the floor on this issue - but also , in particular , because it concerns a pan-European restructuring operation involving the closure of one plant and the loss of thousands of other jobs .
I am pleased with the agreements concluded at the G20 Summit in Pittsburgh .
We need to work together on strengthening the governance of the Single Market and putting in place a more coordinated political leadership approach , which will increase the effectiveness of the Single Market Act and restore citizens &apos; confidence in the initiative .
I should like to point out the inconsistency shown by the Presidency of Parliament : you have just ejected Mr Bloom on account of his remarks to Mr Schulz , even though Mr Schulz called my colleague , Mr van der Stoep , a fascist here in this Chamber and the Presidency did nothing about it .
Democratic and transparent procedures in the conduct of negotiations are required , as well as public debate on their content , something which we consider to be positive .
That is why I am pleased that we are debating this important issue this evening .
I support the rapporteur and therefore voted &apos; in favour &apos; .
Without the control provided by this system , we risk situations arising that are hazardous for the safety of our citizens .
For example , I cannot but highlight the fact that productivity in Greece was not much lower than the average of the EU of the 27 .
The Commission has acted correctly in not closing the door to Bosnia and Herzegovina and Albania .
However , I was unable to vote on this proposal as I had a problem with my voting card .
Climate change ( motions for resolutions tabled ) : see Minutes
This is illustrated by a visit to graveyards in Crete , the island my father hails from : seeing the age people live to there really brings this home to you .
It will now be Brussels which decides what the Dutch are allowed to earn , when the Dutch are allowed to retire and how much they will get from their pensions .
We have a long-standing and robust relationship with Tunisia and close links between our peoples and our business communities .
Firstly , it is unacceptable for the preconditions to be met and for the facility to exist for taking advantage of our cohesion policies and programmes and for this to ultimately be unfeasible for operational and , more importantly , bureaucratic reasons .
rapporteur . - Mr President , I will be very brief .
European parties , with their own ideological and political attributes , must acquire a clear legal personality .
This is a very important issue , and you might say that we have mainly had only good experiences of it in democracies .
It has nothing to do with the war on terror , the controversial concept used by the Chinese Government as a justification for their repressive treatment of the Uighurs in East Turkestan .
On the contrary , we must assume the responsibility for implementing it , improving it where it has failed .
We are going to follow the same method for Albania and Bosnia and Herzegovina .
We will identify the key challenges for the future and set out our response .
A consensus appears to be on the horizon on the need to harmonise , to set up a framework for the certification systems and arrive at mutual recognition between these systems .
On the agenda of the EU-US summit will be increasing jobs on both sides of the Atlantic .
I very much hope that Commissioner De Gucht will reflect its recommendations in the new trade policy communication .
( IT ) Mr President , I voted in favour of this undoubtedly important resolution because it raises the level of protection and guarantees with regard to future drilling in all seas , but especially in fragile seas and in those that have specific features that must be duly taken into account .
That human right was violated in my country for the few Christians attending Christmas mass at the church of Agios Synesios in the occupied village of Rizokarpaso .
However , we must fulfil our commitment regarding climate change : everyone acknowledges that we are the world &apos;s leaders on this issue .
Your Financial Stability Mechanism is a vicious weapon dictated by the markets , masquerading as something benign .
I hope that this is a message that those running this Parliament will really take on board and that they will refrain from topping up the fund using yet more taxpayers &apos; money .
Without it , you will experience yet more avalanches , and this time they will hit populated areas .
Two months ago we were debating precisely this question here , in the context of an emergency resolution on Venezuela .
( EL ) Madam President , I must thank Mrs Stihler for the excellent work she has done .
At its meeting on 27 July 2009 , the Council gave a reminder of the renewed consensus on enlargement that was described in the conclusions of the European Council meeting in December 2006 , including the principle that each country is to be assessed on its own merits , and we decided to initiate the process stated in Article 49 of the Treaty on European Union .
At the present time , we are dealing with a financial crisis , leading to a jobs crisis , in combination with a climate crisis .
However , it should be remembered that the intended addressees of the simplifications should not only be the authorities and national bodies which manage the agriculture sector but , first and foremost , the farmers , who are excessively burdened with regulations .
Our financial instruments need to be adapted in order to provide reliable support for the champions of democracy ...
In the face of the threat Iran poses , we are committed to the security of our allies .
We pin great hopes on the reformulated 2020 strategy as well as on the reformulation of the equal opportunity strategy .
We maintain that introducing a tax on financial transactions would reduce speculation and would improve the functioning of the internal market .
It is necessary to ensure that the substances for which a claim is made have been shown to have a beneficial nutritional or physiological effect .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , allow me first of all to reiterate that the instrument for pre-accession assistance is the Union &apos;s new financing instrument for granting pre-accession assistance for the period 2007-2013 and replaces the previous programmes for candidate and potential candidate countries , namely the PHARE , CARDS , ISPA and other programmes .
I think the political situation in Afghanistan , Pakistan , India and Iran is crucial from the point of view of world security policy .
So we do not agree with that analysis that it was created by big banks .
It is therefore vital that the financial instruments to support the improvement of the energy efficiency of buildings should be accessible to local and regional authorities .
( HU ) In 1992 , the UN declared 17 October the International Day of Poverty .
It is apparent to those of us who are from rural constituencies , and those who sit on the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development , that the current position that many livestock farmers find themselves in is simply unsustainable .
I would like to mention the following things : in the present severe economic crisis , the European Union &apos;s labour market is controlled by the reality that more and more people are being made redundant , which in turn will increase the total number of individuals suffering from poverty and alienation in Europe .
I believe that such measures would strengthen peace in the whole world , but , above all , we should do it simply because the Palestinians deserve their own State .
What is needed is a concerted plan to defend the single currency , to fight off speculation on sovereign debts and to denounce the rating agencies , which are primarily to blame for the crisis we are undergoing .
Our common objectives are , of course , to improve the competitiveness of our economy in the Baltic Sea area , taking particular account of the promotion of small and medium-sized enterprises and of a common energy policy which also takes account of renewable energies .
In the context of this policy , we must address the European Union &apos;s place and role in the world .
An armed attack against Iran in the name of human rights would be considered by all Iranians , regardless of their political positions , as an attack against the country and an additional violation of their fundamental rights .
Clearly , it is to them that our first thoughts must go , as well as to the farmers who are in a very difficult position , one that we can perfectly understand .
There was no reference at all to how rich countries need to show the political will to tackle the problem of our own backyard and show leadership on this .
In view of this , I agree with the rapporteur on the proposal for Parliament to adopt this report and the request for the Council to finalise this procedure without undue delay .
secondly , the lack of uniformity as regards the regional models of organisation of the Member States ;
Nonetheless , the country continues to face many pressing challenges , including the political criteria .
I would like just to pick up on two or three of the key areas that were discussed .
Mr President , on behalf of one of my constituents I want to raise the case of a young man with dual British / Greek nationality named John Zafiropoulos .
As my colleague just said , and I too am confident , the Lisbon Treaty will be in force fairly soon .
Now , when Lampedusa becomes overcrowded - which it already is - everyone will be sent to Italy and at least the situation will be more bearable .
The issue under consideration concerns the Treaty of Lisbon , in particular , how to reconcile its Articles 75 and 215 with regard to Parliament &apos;s competence in the procedure for adopting restrictive measures against certain persons and entities .
With regard to the outcome of the aforementioned negotiations , it is worth highlighting , in particular , the significant increase in the financial mechanism , although the position of Iceland is unchanged due to the severe crisis that it is experiencing .
I therefore also supported those amendments that back small , family-run businesses and I voted against the pernicious mass imports of soya into Europe .
The Group of the European People &apos;s Party ( Christian Democrats ) has taken the initiative for this debate because the problems in the euro area countries make a strong European approach very urgent .
Therefore , while we do need to remain vigilant about fraud , we also need to simply , simplify and simplify again the rules .
The framework for coordinated action should be understood as a safety net to be used only when all other means to avoid a crisis have been exhausted , including , first and foremost , exhausting the scope for policy action at domestic level .
Then there is the Refoundation Party , which has its own newspaper , Liberazione .
This means that we cannot now simply apply the number laid down in the Treaty of Lisbon , namely the 751 MEPs , given that under Lisbon a certain country loses three Members who have been elected and , therefore , cannot leave Parliament during this parliamentary term .
I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday , 11 November 2010 .
I would be very grateful if you could tell us to what extent you have such exclusions and possible limits for them in view in the negotiations .
I have not yet seen a constitution of a European Union Member State which is against those values , but if , theoretically , that were to happen then we would have to act .
I appreciated the method followed by the rapporteur in evaluating the outcome and modalities of the EU cooperation for development .
When they met with the Commission in March 2009 , the Iraqi authorities reiterated their commitment to respecting international humanitarian standards and not using force , and in particular to not conducting forced returns to Iraq .
The report constitutes an important and strategic statement by the Commission on a key aspect of the &apos; Better Lawmaking &apos; programme .
The immediate consequence of the outbreak has been a noticeable drop in fruit and vegetable consumption throughout Europe .
I do not want to go anywhere .
The CAP also needs to contribute towards the achievement of the ambitious objectives contained in the Europe 2020 strategy ; in other words we need a greener and more sustainable CAP that will guarantee additional funding for farmers while recognising their role in protecting the environment , and that will help them choose environmentally friendly farming techniques .
We must do everything we can to protect the end users of financial services , and so the new agreement must provide for a system that does not force banks to pass on their operating costs to them .
Once again , we have witnessed the destruction by Israel of projects funded by the European Union and , rather than take action on this , we are talking about upgrading trade relations when conditions on human rights are currently being breached under the current agreements .
The EU regulation on credit-rating agencies will improve integrity , transparency , responsibility and good governance in the credit-rating activities .
The very aim of the proposal for a directive as regards information to the general public on medicinal products subject to medical prescription is to provide simple information that is easy to understand and use , but that avoids forms of advertising .
I agree with the proposal that a very clear distinction needs to be maintained between the remits of military and humanitarian bodies , so that military resources and capabilities are used only in a very limited number of cases and as a last resort , particularly in those regions affected by armed conflicts .
The Council and the majority of the European Parliament yielded in the face of enormous pressure from the financial lobby .
Our thoughts continue to be with their family , and we praise the ongoing efforts of the UK Foreign Office , who are using all possible connections in East Africa to negotiate the pair &apos;s speedy release .
